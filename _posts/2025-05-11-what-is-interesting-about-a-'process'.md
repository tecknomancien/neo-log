What is interesting about a 'process' is that it seems to exist across many different disciplines and manifestations, yet always involves a sequence or interaction of elements to create something new, whether it be a tangible object or intangible idea. It appears to be fundamental to human understanding and expression, whether we are discussing the creation of complex machines, understanding biological mechanisms, developing software, analyzing data, or creating art through language or images. It suggests an intricate choreography of action and reaction that is essential for progress and innovation, both personally and collectively.
