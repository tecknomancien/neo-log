"If I multiply both sides by PQ^T, I should get PAQx=PBQy". Since Q is orthogonal, Q^T=Q^-1, so I can rewrite the right-hand side as BQY. But since B is block upper triangular, we know that each block column contains enough information for finding its corresponding block row; thus, they must lie within those blocks themselves due to orthogonality constraints from P and Q."
