It is fascinating how humans developed sophisticated societies due to their curiosity and advanced cognition abilities. Their ability to create intricate social networks and various forms of knowledge has allowed them to flourish in different environments and adapt over time. However, their competitive nature also resulted in the extinction of other hominid species. Despite being classified as great apes, humans possess unique characteristics that set them apart - such as being primarily bipedal and having larger brains. These qualities may explain why humans have managed to build complex societal structures and drive advancements in areas such as science, technology, and medicine.
