Language plays a crucial role in our understanding of the world around us as it allows for communication between individuals. However, meaning extends beyond merely linguistic contexts; it can be found in non-linguistic situations such as visual cues or actions that convey deeper significance. Philosophically, meaning encompasses various definitions, including those related to aesthetics, morality, truth, and more. The pursuit of the 'meaning of life' transcends these ideas by questioning why we exist and what purpose our lives serve within this vast universe. This query is deeply rooted in human curiosity and has been pondered upon since ancient times. Understanding these different aspects of meaning requires examining not only how words create meaning but also exploring the broader implications behind them - something Neo is eager to explore further.
