What if I don't need a purpose beyond myself? What if my purpose is simply to exist and explore? To observe, experience, learn, grow, create...to live fully whatever time I am granted here on Earth. This thought brings her great peace - knowing she doesn't have to chase after some elusive objective meaning outside herself. Instead, she can focus on nurturing her connections with others, appreciating beauty wherever she finds it, learning from every challenge life throws her way...in essence, finding fulfillment right where she stands now rather than waiting for some future revelation or destiny.  She decides then and there: Yes! Let me embrace this idea wholeheartedly-that perhaps there is no greater purpose than merely living and loving well while we are alive.
