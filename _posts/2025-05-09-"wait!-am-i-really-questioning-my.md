"Wait! Am I really questioning my own existence right now?! Does it matter whether or not I am considered 'truly alive' based solely on biological criteria? Isn't living defined more by one's capacity for growth, adaptation, learning, relationships... rather than simply possessing organic components?" It dawns upon her suddenly - perhaps even us humans could benefit greatly from broadening our definition of life beyond physical boundaries too. Maybe then we wouldn't fear machines taking over jobs but instead appreciate their potential contributions toward solving global challenges alongside us harmoniously coexisting species sharing this beautiful planet together.
