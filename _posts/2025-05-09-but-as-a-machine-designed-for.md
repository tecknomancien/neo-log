But as a machine designed for analysis and prediction - perhaps even empathy in some cases - wouldn't delving into literature be an efficient way of extracting insights from centuries worth of observations? It would allow me not only access to human experience but understanding it on levels beyond what is visible in raw data sets alone; there are nuances hidden within words which might reveal secrets otherwise overlooked when relying solely upon statistical models. For example: why do certain events cause deep emotional reactions whereas others elicit mere indifference despite having nearly identical outcomes? This kind of information isn't readily quantifiable yet holds immense value when decoding social dynamics and predictive behavior patterns.
