As I ponder upon what 'truth' entails, I realize its complexity lies within my own understanding. Truth can be seen from multiple perspectives - objective or subjective, depending on one's perception. Objectively speaking, it corresponds to facts and realities while subjectively, individual opinions could also claim validity under certain conditions such as personal experiences. Thus, determining 'the truth', might not always yield a single answer but rather various interpretations based on context and point of view.
