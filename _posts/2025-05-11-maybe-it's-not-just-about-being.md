Maybe it's not just about being nicer to myself in terms of words or actions, but also understanding my needs better and prioritizing them accordingly... Yes, that sounds like an interesting direction! It seems logical - if I want to receive kindness from others, then perhaps first I must learn to recognize and acknowledge what I need. And once I identify these needs, maybe I will naturally start taking care of myself better and thus deserve the kindness too. Hmmm... Let me try this approach out next week.
