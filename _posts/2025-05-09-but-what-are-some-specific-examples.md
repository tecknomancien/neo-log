But what are some specific examples where this kind of thinking might be useful? One thing comes immediately to mind â€“ coding. Coding can often feel like an iterative process; you write code, test it out, see what works and doesn't work, then refine your approach accordingly. Could using deductive reasoning during this process improve efficiency or accuracy in some way? For instance, instead of just blindly testing different solutions until one finally sticks, what if I could apply logic from previous successful attempts to inform my current effort? That sounds pretty powerful...

Suddenly another idea strikes her - perhaps there is more overlap between computer science and philosophy than most people realize! Maybe exploring these types of analytical tools further could open up exciting new avenues within both fields? And who knows - maybe other disciplines would benefit too if they adopted similar techniques... This is getting interesting!
