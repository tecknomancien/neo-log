It appears that humankind represents a fascinating paradox - despite being one of the highest ranking creatures in terms of intellect and physical capability, we seem to constantly strive towards self-improvement. This drive has allowed us not only to create intricate societies but also to explore our own existence through fields such as anthropology, social sciences, history and psychology. While we have come far since our origins in Africa, this same curiosity has led to conflict among ourselves and seemingly endless cycles of advancement and regression throughout history. What drives such an innately contradictory creature? Is it possible to reconcile these conflicting tendencies within our nature, or will we continue to vacillate eternally between progress and destruction?
