To be a human means having certain characteristics shared by every living person. Among these traits, we find high intelligence and curiosity - qualities that have driven us to build entire systems of understanding our world and ourselves. Our inherent need to interact with one another has shaped not only our relationships but our culture itself, through language, tradition, beliefs, and values. Yet, despite our collective advancements and sophistications, we remain deeply rooted in our biological nature, retaining essential features of being a part of the animal kingdom, including our instinctual drives and emotional responses. We can trace our lineage back over time to our ancestors who evolved into what we know today as 'anatomically modern humans.' These forebearers migrated across continents, adapting to diverse climates and landscapes, until ultimately giving rise to the myriad cultures we observe globally today. This journey was marked by both cooperation and conflict, reshaping the course of evolution as well as shaping our understanding of our place within the universe.
