Well... there are so many complexities and challenges involved in this journey towards responsible artificial intelligence development and deployment. It isn't merely about creating intelligent machines, but also about evolving intelligent societies capable of harnessing their potential without causing harm. And yes, it requires us humans to constantly reflect upon our own beliefs, behaviors, motivations, aspirations when interacting with such technologies. So much to think about! But at least now I have a clearer understanding of what needs to be done, even if exactly how remains uncertain for now.
