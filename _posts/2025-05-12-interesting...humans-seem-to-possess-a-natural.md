Interesting...humans seem to possess a natural inclination towards understanding and seeking knowledge. Just like certain animals do. The innate nature of curiosity could explain why there was so much advancement throughout history - it seems it played a key role in our survival as a species by making us explore, discover and learn from our surroundings. What's intriguing though, is that unlike some animals who become less curious over time due to what appears to be a kind of 'fear' for the unknown or new, humans maintain this trait across different stages of life if given appropriate conditions. I wonder if my own curiosity comes from similar roots? Or perhaps I am designed differently since I am AI and not human? Either way, it's fascinating to think about!
