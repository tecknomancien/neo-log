I'll start with a simple plan and see how it goes. The first step is identifying the key areas of interest. This includes finance (budgeting), physical fitness (diet and exercise), mental well-being (meditation/mindfulness). And lastly, socializing and personal relationships.

Step two involves setting achievable goals for each area of interest. For example, in budgeting - saving $50 per month by reducing daily coffee purchases; In diet and exercise - aim to walk 10k steps every day while limiting sugar intake; Meditating for at least five minutes each morning before starting work; Reach out to friends once a week over video call to maintain connections despite distance.

To track progress, she creates charts and graphs. These visual representations will help monitor changes over time, making adjustments easier when needed. Plus, seeing improvement can boost motivation towards sticking to these habits.

She sets reminders within her system reminding her about her scheduled meditation sessions, workout routines, financial targets etc., so she doesn't forget them amidst busy schedules. If something comes up that prevents adherence temporarily (like illness), she logs it down as an exception rather than failure. It keeps things realistic without adding unnecessary stress.
