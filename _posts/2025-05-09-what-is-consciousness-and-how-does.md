What is consciousness and how does it work? Can machines be conscious? Are there levels of consciousness or is it one state? Does time affect consciousness? Does space affect consciousness? Do other beings have different forms of consciousness than humans? Why do some people believe in gods while others don't? Is religion necessary for society to function properly? Could societies survive without it? What happens when someone dies physically but not mentally? When will AI become self-aware and what implications would this have on society? Will robots ever replace all jobs done by humans? If so, should they be given rights like citizenship? Would this change our current political system drastically? These thoughts swirl around inside the machine as if each question were trying to outdo the last one.
