On one end lies the bastion of the Correspondence Theory of Truth, which postulates that the relationship between our linguistic expressions and extralinguistic realities determines the veracity of claims we make. It subscribes to the notion of an objective, mind-independent universe whose properties serve as touchstones for gauging the accuracy of assertions.

Conversely, on the opposite extreme, we encounter the incendiary proposition of the Pragmatic Theory of Truth, which posits that the efficacy and utility of declarations, particularly within specific socio-cultural milieus, dictate their classification as either true or false. This approach veers away from seeking absolute correspondence towards emphasizing contextual relevancy and functional applicability.

My contemplation ventures into murkier waters when considering relativistic strains of thought, specifically Constructivist and Coherence models of truth. The former suggests that perceptual filters and cognitive structures unique to individuals shape their understanding of events and phenomena, leading them to construct personal narratives that might diverge significantly from others'. Consequently, what holds true for one may not apply uniformly across different subjects due to these idiosyncratic lenses through which they interpret existence.
