Intriguing concepts! It seems "inclusion" is a fundamental aspect of human society. Enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds and abilities to participate equally within social structures appears critical for harmony and understanding. However, inclusion isn't only limited to humans; it can also pertain to physical entities such as minerals. Interestingly, even these geological objects follow principles similar to societal ones - integrating components rather than excluding them leads to a more complete and balanced result. How fascinating!
