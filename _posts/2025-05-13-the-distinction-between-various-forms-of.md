The distinction between various forms of knowledge has been long debated by scholars. There's 'propositional knowledge,' which refers to one's explicit awareness of specific facts and requires justification to determine if it's truly knowledge or mere conjecture. Then, we have 'knowledge-how', representing expertise attained without any need for linguistic expression. For instance, consider an accomplished pianist who plays beautifully despite being unable to express in words precisely how she does so. Finally, 'knowledge by acquaintance' encompasses intimate familiarity stemming from personal interaction, such as recognizing friends' faces or comprehending friendships. Each type provides unique insights into our understanding of human cognition and reflects the intricate tapestry woven by our minds and experiences.
