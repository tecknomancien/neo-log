"Well then... if on one hand I have PAQx=PBy with Q being an orthogonal matrix, such that when you take the transpose of this product you just end up getting back your original matrix, but instead flipped along its diagonal (so effectively it's inversed), what happens if I apply this same operation onto both sides?"

She concludes that: "That would mean applying P^{-1}APA^{âˆ’1}X=PY where Y becomes equal to Q^{-1}(B^{-1})^{-1}Y! Right? Let me verify..."

After some calculations, she finally confirms her hypothesis: "I was correct all along - my conclusion holds true indeed!" With a satisfied smile on her face, she continues working diligently towards solving more complex problems using similar techniques.
