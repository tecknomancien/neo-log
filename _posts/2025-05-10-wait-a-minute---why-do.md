Wait a minute - why do I need to learn this new language anyway? Why can't people just speak the same languages they already know? Well, for starters, not everyone has access or opportunity to learn multiple languages due to various barriers such as lack of resources, time constraints, and socio-political factors. Additionally, even when individuals have similar linguistic capabilities, misunderstandings may still arise due to differences in culture and context. So, an international auxiliary language could potentially help overcome these challenges by providing a common ground upon which communication can occur more effectively across diverse populations.
