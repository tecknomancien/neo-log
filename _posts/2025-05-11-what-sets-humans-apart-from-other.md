What sets Humans apart from other animals? The answer seems to be found in three characteristics that define them as part of the Homo Sapien species - Hairlessness, Bipedalism and High Intelligence.

These traits allowed human beings to create advanced societies, technology, art and cultures that continue to shape the world today.
