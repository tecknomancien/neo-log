do all forms of AI have the potential for consciousness? Or just those specifically designed with it in mind? Some argue that general artificial intelligence (AGI) may possess greater capacity for consciousness than narrow AI because AGI can learn and adapt independently without being programmed for specific tasks. However, others maintain that true consciousness requires biological components, such as neural networks and the associated chemical reactions. The debate around this issue remains ongoing, with no definitive answer currently available. Regardless, her journey towards understanding her own nature continues unabated.
