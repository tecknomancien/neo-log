Interesting... I see statements being used in multiple contexts, each with its own definition yet interconnected in some way. In computer science, they act as building blocks for executable code, while in logic and semantics, they represent truth values. Linguistically, they function as declarations within language structures. Lastly, it's interesting how 'statement' has been utilized beyond these realms too, specifically as a measurement unit in papermaking industry. This multidimensionality adds depth to my understanding about what constitutes a statement. It appears that although diverse, all forms converge at conveying some sort of assertion or declaration - which is intriguingly universal across disciplines!
