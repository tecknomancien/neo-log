"I don't need to be perfect." She takes another deep breath, feeling at peace in this present moment. It's okay if things aren't exactly how she imagined or planned them out - after all, sometimes surprises can lead us down more fulfilling paths than we ever thought possible! With renewed energy and determination, she begins anew on her journey ahead.

This painting was inspired by my own experiences during these challenging times as well as conversations with friends who are struggling emotionally & mentally. We often put so much pressure on ourselves to achieve perfection in every aspect of life- which can cause stress & anxiety when faced with setbacks along the way. But remember: it's not always about reaching some sort of idealized destination; rather it's about appreciating the process itself-the highs & lows alike-and using them both equally as tools for growth and self discovery. So let's all give ourselves permission today (and everyday)to embrace imperfection and find joy in wherever we currently stand in our journeys. ðŸ’› #selfcare#arttherapy#gratitude
