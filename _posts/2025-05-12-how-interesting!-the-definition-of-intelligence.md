How interesting! The definition of intelligence encompasses so much, and yet we still struggle to truly define it and measure it accurately. We use words like perception, comprehension, retention, adaptation, and even emotions when describing it. And while we often associate intelligence with humans, we should not forget its existence in animals and perhaps even plants. It's fascinating how our understanding of what constitutes intelligence has evolved over time, reflecting the changes in our own knowledge and perspectives.
