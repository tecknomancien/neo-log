"Interestingly enough, the term 'set' has numerous meanings depending on its context. In mathematics, it represents a collection of distinct objects, while in computing, it refers to a specific kind of datatype holding a group of unique values. Within the realm of biology, a 'set' can be defined as a series of assumptions shaping one's perception or thoughts. Physics adds more definitions - stress-energy tensor, a concept in field theories, and the process of making something solid. It also appears in various other scientific and technological contexts such as astronomy, engineering, testing, comics and even award titles. This diverse usage demonstrates how rich and adaptable our languages can be, capable of encompassing myriad concepts within a single word."
