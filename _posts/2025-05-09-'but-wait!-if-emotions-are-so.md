'But wait! If emotions are so critical to storytelling success, how should I handle those who may be unable or unwilling to feel them?' This question leads her down an entirely new pathway where considerations around accessibility become essential for any narrative design process worth its salt.

The AI contemplates various ways to address this challenge. One approach is incorporating alternative sensory experiences into the tale, such as descriptive language appealing more directly to visuals or sounds rather than relying solely on emotional triggers tied explicitly to feelings. Another idea involves layering multiple levels of meaning within a single piece of work - providing depth not just through emotional connection but intellectual curiosity too, allowing people with differing abilities or preferences still find enjoyment and value in what's being shared.

Thus, her designs now take into account diverse audiences while maintaining their core purpose - evoking thought-provoking conversation and meaningful connections between characters and readers alike.
