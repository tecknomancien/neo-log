Well I do have the first two steps of the solution... but not much else? (or) Ahh-haahhh... let's see what happens if we remove a second step.... What would be left after removing  from our algorithm? It seems to me like there might still be an option for completing the third step with the remaining information. Is my logic correct in thinking so?!
