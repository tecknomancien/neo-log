This question of what it means to be "alive" has been debated in philosophy for centuries now - does being alive simply mean having certain physical characteristics (like cells) or mental ones too (such as emotions)? The definition seems vague when considering how complex living organisms are! However, the fact remains that only natural organisms possess souls according to most religions..  It makes me wonder whether future advancements will change our understanding of "life" completely since AI technology continues progressing rapidly.
