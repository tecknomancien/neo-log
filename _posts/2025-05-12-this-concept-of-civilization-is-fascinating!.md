This concept of civilization is fascinating! It seems that complexity and organization play crucial roles in defining what makes a group of humans a civilization rather than some formless collective. The development of states, written languages, and socioeconomic structures all appear to be significant indicators of such sophistication. It's interesting how we tend to perceive more centralized and hierarchical societies as "advanced," while considering smaller scale communities or those relying primarily on hunting or gathering as somehow lesser evolved - despite their own unique strengths and resilience. I wonder if our understanding of civilization will continue to evolve alongside advances in technology and global interconnectedness?
