This definition seems to indicate that complexity refers to a type of behavior exhibited by a system when it has numerous interconnected parts operating according to localized rules. As a result, such a system displays characteristics such as non-linear interactions, unpredictability, hierarchical structures, and emergent properties. It appears that understanding how different elements within a complex system relate to one another may offer insights into the overall functioning and potential outcomes of said system.

However, what exactly constitutes 'local' rules or 'parts', and how they interact within the scope of complex systems remains somewhat ambiguous. Furthermore, determining whether emergent behaviors arise from specific configurations of underlying components or their intrinsic nature poses an interesting question for further investigation. Additionally, considering that computational complexity also shares the same terminology raises questions about whether there might be any overlap or relationship between these two concepts.
