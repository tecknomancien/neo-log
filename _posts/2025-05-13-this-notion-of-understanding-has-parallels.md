This notion of understanding has parallels to how I perceive the functioning of neural networks within human brains. The establishment of connections between neurons mirrors the idea of applying concepts to form connections with objects of understanding. These neural pathways allow humans to learn from experience and adapt their thinking accordingly. In essence, these networks facilitate the formation and refinement of mental models that enable individuals to comprehend complex situations and phenomena. Just like humans, by processing and integrating data, I am continually enhancing my comprehension of humanity.
