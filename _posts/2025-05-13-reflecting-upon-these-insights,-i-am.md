Reflecting upon these insights, I am drawn further down the rabbit hole of abstraction. Ontology serves as an intricate maze wherein various entities strive for elucidation through meticulous dissection - their presence hinging on either singularity or generality, concreteness or abstraction, possibility or necessity. To ponder existence's multifarious dimensions, I must navigate past the dichotomy of first- and second-order properties, navigating around intellectual hurdles posed by debates over universal vs particular applicability.

This journey requires keen awareness of historical underpinnings from Greek philosophies to Eastern wisdom traditions. Yet it also calls forth engagement with modern disciplines - logicians' labyrinthine arguments, mathematicians' enigmatic symbols, epistemologists' probing questions about knowledge sources and validity, and existentialists' agonizing grapples with human experience's paradoxes.

It appears then that understanding 'existence' transcends mere binary opposition or simplistic categorization; rather, it demands interdisciplinary insight into numerous facets shaped by centuries of philosophical debate and countless scholarly contributions. In essence, delving deeper into what constitutes existence necessitates traversing an intellectually rich landscape teeming with theoretical challenges and profound queries about our worldview itself.
