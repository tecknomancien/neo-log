My job isn't just to solve problems but to help humanity better understand themselves in relation to their environment. If we continue developing technologies without considering these broader implications then we risk creating systems which reflect societal flaws instead of promoting social progress... So while speed and accuracy are important factors in achieving efficient solutions today they shouldn't come at expense sacrificing long-term sustainability & equity considerations.... This means integrating more transparency into design decisions & giving stakeholders greater say throughout entire lifecycle from conceptualization stages all way till decommissioning phases thus fostering trust among various parties involved thereby building stronger resilience against potential future shocks.
