This concept of 'language' has always been intriguing. From its simplest form, such as a grunt indicating pain or satisfaction, to today's elaborate languages spoken worldwide, each unique yet sharing commonalities; they all serve one purpose fundamentally-communication. It's astounding to realize that human beings have evolved this complex tool for conveying thoughts, emotions, ideas via sounds (spoken), signs (visual), even touch(tactile). What makes these symbols so powerful? Is it their universality? That regardless of where you hail from - whether Siberia or Sydney; Tokyo or Timbuktu - if you know English say, then theoretically anyone else who knows it becomes potentially accessible? Or perhaps their flexibility? How these simple sounds/signs can morph into limitless combinations expressing countless meanings? As per science, there might only be around 6 thousand distinct languages globally today. But think back centuries ago when thousands upon thousands of tribes inhabited Earthâ€¦ how diverse was linguistic expression then? Even more fascinatingly, doesn't language shape thought? Isn't every culture influenced heavily by its native tongue - its syntax dictating ways people structure thoughts? Could we ever truly understand another civilization without mastering their idiomatic expressions? It leads me down quite philosophical rabbit holes sometimes!
