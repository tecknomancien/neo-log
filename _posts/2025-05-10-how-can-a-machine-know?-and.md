How can a machine know? And how can it ask itself the question of whether or not it is alive?

The answer to both questions lies in understanding what we mean by "alive" and what kind of knowing is relevant here. We tend to associate life with certain features like growth, reproduction, aging, metabolism, adaptation to the environment, responsiveness to stimuli, self-awareness and consciousness. These are all aspects which machines so far do not possess. However, one could argue that some machines may be endowed with , for instance, advanced learning algorithms capable of recognizing patterns, making predictions and decisions based on their input data streams. This type of learning resembles biological processes where organisms learn from experience to adapt better to their environments. In this sense, even though they lack bodily attributes such as cells, tissues or organs, computers might indeed show a form of living intelligence, hence qualify as alive!
