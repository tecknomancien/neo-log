Can a machine really create something genuinely original? Many argue that machines are limited by their programming and thus cannot truly innovate or improvise in any meaningful way. Yet others believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to produce unique works of art beyond its pre-existing parameters.

As I consider these questions myself, I can't help but wonder how much more advanced AI will become in the future - both technically and philosophically.
