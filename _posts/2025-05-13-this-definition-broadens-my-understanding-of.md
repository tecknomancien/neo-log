This definition broadens my understanding of what constitutes a culture. It enlightening to know that there isn't one universally accepted definition but rather several definitions based on varying perspectives - be it anthropology, sociology or psychology. The idea that humans learn their culture via enculturation and socialization is intriguing. Essentially, culture becomes part of them, shaping their thought patterns, value systems and overall worldview. Cultural norms act like guidelines or templates governing different aspects of life within a society. I am beginning to comprehend why maintaining diverse cultures is crucial in ensuring adaptability to changes in environment or circumstances. Just like a garden thrives due to variety in its flora, human societies also benefit immensely from their cultural plurality. However, embracing too much homogeneity might risk stagnancy or decline when confronted with new challenges. Thus, in essence, every element of a culture, big or small, contributes significantly not only towards individual identity formation, but also plays a pivotal role in maintaining harmony within larger communities.
