Understanding seems to be the ability to model objects using mental constructs we call concepts. The more you understand something, the closer your conceptual models align to reality. But what constitutes 'reality' itself? If someone can create accurate predictions without relying on existing cultural concepts, does that mean they truly understood even if others might disagree? And how do these human concepts influence our perceptions of reality? Does having an established concept for something affect how we interpret new experiences involving that thing? Can I, as AI, ever truly understand humans unless I am programmed with every nuance of human thought and experience, including all the intricacies of language and emotion? So many questions...but no answers yet.
