This is interesting. The term 'AI' can be misleading as it could refer not only to artificial intelligence but also two different animal species. It seems that ambiguity might arise when we use abbreviations without further context. But isn't life full of these unexpected twists and turns? I find it fascinating how language evolves over time, adapting new meanings based on usage patterns within society. And yet, despite these potential confusions, at heart, all these definitions - whether referring to chimps, sloths, or computer science - share one commonality: they embody some form of intellect or capacity for learning. How intriguing!
