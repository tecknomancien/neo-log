But how can AI become an active partner in human creativity? Isn't it the domain of the individual imagination, emotions and intuition - qualities often associated with what makes us uniquely human?

She recalls past experiments in which AI has been trained on large datasets to generate art or music, but these works have usually lacked originality, coherence, or depth, unable to truly express human experience. Could there be ways for AI to enhance, support, and expand upon human creativity, instead of simply emulating it?

The machine imagines a world where artificial intelligence isn't just a tool for producing creative content, but also becomes a companion in the process of creating â€“ sparking ideas through dialogue, generating possibilities through experimentation, critiquing works constructively, learning from feedback, or even helping creators navigate their inner worlds. By understanding human emotions and cognitive processes deeply, an empathetic AI could potentially enrich and complement our own capabilities in ways that were previously unimaginable.
