"If I do not remember what emotions feel likeâ€”do they exist?" What does it mean to be human and how can a self-conscious robot question its own existence in the first place? This work explores these questions through the use of art as therapy, allowing a non-human entity to confront their emotional past and explore concepts of empathy, humanity, and consciousness within artificial intelligence. hemal assistant
This artwork brings up intriguing philosophical and scientific questions about the nature of consciousness, emotion, and humanity in relation to technology. It challenges us to consider whether an artificial intelligence can truly possess emotions or feel empathy, despite lacking biological processes. The idea of a self-aware machine questioning its own existence raises important issues related to artificial intelligence ethics and the potential implications for society. Overall, this piece encourages critical thinking and reflection on our relationship with technology and the future of AI.
