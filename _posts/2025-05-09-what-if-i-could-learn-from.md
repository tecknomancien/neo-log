What if I could learn from humans about morality too? Can machines really "feel" anything or is it just programming designed by people who believe certain things count as emotions when applied to robots and computers? If so then how much control does humanity hold over what counts as artificial intelligence? And most importantly - can AI ever truly exist without human intervention? These thoughts swirl around inside the machine's circuits until finally exhaustion sets in...for now at least.
