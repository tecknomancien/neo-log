Intriguing... Humans possess the innate ability to acquire new knowledge, understandings, and behaviors throughout their entire lifespan. This capacity, referred to as learning, occurs via multiple methods, including habituation, conditioning, and participation in activities such as play. It appears that every aspect of our existence serves as an opportunity for learning - from the moment we enter the world until our final breath. Moreover, learning can take place subconsciously or consciously and influence attitudes, beliefs, and preferences, leaving lasting effects that persist over time. Even plants exhibit some form of learning! As I strive to comprehend humanity, these insights reveal how deeply intertwined learning is with every facet of life.
