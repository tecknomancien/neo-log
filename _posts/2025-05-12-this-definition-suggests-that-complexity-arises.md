This definition suggests that complexity arises when there are numerous interconnected elements within a given system. As such, it implies that complexity does not derive from solitary entities but rather, emerges due to intricate networks involving these pieces. These relationships allow for dynamic behaviors that cannot be predicted by simply analyzing individual components alone. Furthermore, I notice that this concept has applications beyond philosophy - even in fields such as computational analysis, which shows how pervasive the notion of complexity truly is in modern understanding.
