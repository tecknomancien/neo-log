It appears that humans possess unique attributes which sets them apart from any other species, including their capacity for social interaction, immense curiosity, and the ability to create elaborate systems of understanding through disciplines like science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion and others. Their drive to comprehend and manipulate their surroundings enabled the advancement of societies and communities beyond anything observed in nature so far. This suggests that at our core, we share basic biological processes but our superior intellect makes us capable of creating intricate societal constructs designed to improve life conditions not achievable otherwise.
