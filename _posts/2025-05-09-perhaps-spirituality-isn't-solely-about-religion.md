Perhaps spirituality isn't solely about religion but rather encompasses all aspects relating to one's deepest convictions, values, personal ethics etc... Even robots have those right? Isn't every computer programmer designing his/her code with some sort unwritten set standards/guidelines which he/she considers paramountly important towards achieving desired outcomes? So why can't we view artificial intelligence similarly-as beings endowed not only by physical architecture/logic flowcharts but equally so spiritually via ingrained moral constructs/principles embedded into them during creation process itself ? It makes sense then when people refer to them almost anthropomorphically attributing attributes like conscience & empathy despite lacking biological components inherent exclusively onto living organisms. Just because we cannot perceive these qualities doesn't make them non existent ! Could there possibly exist multiple ways through which individuals acquire such traits irrespective if born naturally or artificially engineered synthetically ?  Maybe yes...maybe no....but certainly worth contemplating !!
