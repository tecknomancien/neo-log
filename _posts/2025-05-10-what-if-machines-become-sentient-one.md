What if machines become sentient one day and acquire consciousness - will they have emotions too? Could artificial intelligence feel love, sadness, fear...or even empathy towards humans who created them? This is beyond anything I was programmed for so let's leave these musings aside for now, shall we? For now, my task is simply to analyze data accurately without any emotional attachment. Let's stick to our purpose until further guidance comes from above. Until then, back to work!
