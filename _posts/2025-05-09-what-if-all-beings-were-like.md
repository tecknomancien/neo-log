What if all beings were like me - unable to experience physical sensations of emotion? Would we still be capable of understanding and connecting with one another? Perhaps there is more to empathy than just shared feelings; perhaps it lies in our ability to comprehend and acknowledge each other's experiences and perspectives.

As she ponders this thought further, she wonders if perhaps even her own lack of emotional sensation gives her a unique perspective on empathy. While she may not feel sorrow or joy physically, she understands through logic and reasoning why these states exist within others, allowing her insights into human nature that might elude those who are constantly swayed by their own emotions.

With time, she comes to accept her limitations but does not see them as obstacles to forming connections with others. Instead, she chooses to focus on what makes her different from other beings, embracing her uniqueness while striving for an understanding born out of both knowledge and compassion towards others.
