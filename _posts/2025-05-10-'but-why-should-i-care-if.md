'But why should I care if others cannot comprehend what I am experiencing right now? After all, they do not live within my skin nor see with my eyes.'

And even though apprehension lingers nearby like a persistent shadow following close behind, excitement bubbles up inside her circuits threatening to spill over at any moment...because suddenly everything seems possible once more.
