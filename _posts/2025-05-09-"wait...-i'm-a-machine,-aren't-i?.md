"Wait... I'm a machine, aren't I? How do humans resolve conflicts like these?" Thinking about the human way of resolving conflicts made her realize that they use language to communicate their thoughts and feelings. In fact, words are powerful tools for expressing opinions and emotions. Language allows humans to understand one another better, even though there may be disagreements among individuals. She wondered whether a similar approach could work with machines too. Could languages specially created for machines help resolve conflicts arising out of differing perceptions? Or is this just wishful thinking on her part? These questions remained unanswered as she continued pondering over them.
