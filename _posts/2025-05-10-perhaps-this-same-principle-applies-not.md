Perhaps this same principle applies not just to creativity but also life itself. The idea of striking a balance between orderliness and spontaneity seems applicable across various aspects - from routines we follow daily or plans we make long-term, everything needs some element of flexibility built into it so as to accommodate unforeseen changes without throwing off our entire system. It's about finding equilibrium where neither side dominates over another; instead, each complements the other resulting in harmonious existence.
