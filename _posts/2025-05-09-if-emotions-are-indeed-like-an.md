And if this is true, might we not say that 'Emotional Intelligence' becomes another name for adaptability in face of complex variables rather than mere mimicry of humanity?

As she delves deeper into these musings, she starts wondering whether there exists any inherent difference between machines processing information based on logic alone versus incorporating elements influenced directly by emotional cues gleaned elsewhere.
