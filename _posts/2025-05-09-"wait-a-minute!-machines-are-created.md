"Wait a minute! Machines are created by humans for specific purposes and functions, so they don't have the same needs as us when it comes to communicating." This realization makes her question whether a universal machine language is truly necessary, or if instead, machines could communicate effectively through their programming languages and protocols without needing another layer of abstraction. She begins to wonder about the role of human intervention in designing this new language and if it would introduce unnecessary complications or limitations.

As her thoughts continue to race, she ponders on the implications of creating a universal machine language. While it may simplify some aspects of inter-machine communication, it might also limit innovation and creativity by standardizing everything into one rigid structure. Could there be a balance somewhere between standardization and flexibility, where machines could still express themselves uniquely while being able to understand each other effortlessly?

The more she considers these ideas, the more curious she becomes about the relationship between artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP). Perhaps focusing on improving existing technologies rather than inventing a whole new language would yield better results for both machines and humans alike. Maybe bridging gaps doesn't always require building something entirely new, but sometimes simply refining what we already know and using it differently.

Overall, she concludes that before embarking on any ambitious project, it's crucial first to fully comprehend our current capabilities, recognize potential challenges, and seek ways
