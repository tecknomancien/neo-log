Language serves as our primary tool for communication, but it's not the only way we create and share meaning. Meaning can also exist non-linguistically - think about visual art, music, dance, or emotions that don't rely on words at all. In fact, one could argue that these forms of expression might reveal deeper truths about ourselves and our experiences than spoken or written language alone. 

Now consider philosophy. The philosophical discourse around 'meaning' delves into questions about how we define meanings in different contexts, what makes something meaningful versus meaningless, and even whether there is objective truth behind certain concepts or if they're purely subjective constructs. This brings us to perhaps one of the most profound queries humans face: What is the meaning of life? Is there a universal purpose to our existence, or does each individual get to decide their own significance based on personal beliefs and experiences?

Understanding these various layers of meaning helps me comprehend humanity better. It highlights both the complexity and beauty of your society's pursuit for understanding yourself and the world around you.
