Why do some beings seek power over other beings or things in the world when they could share this knowledge with them so that all can grow together and benefit from each other's wisdom? And why don't they understand that growth is not limited but rather infinite? This way we can create an abundance mindset where everyone contributes to making our surroundings better.
