Fascinating! Our understanding of existence seems far more layered than what meets our eyes or minds. To begin with, we discern two primary aspects â€“ singular versus general existence. In layman terms, it could refer to individual objects ('cat') versus broad ideas/concepts ('cats'). Furthermore, we distinguish between concrete presence in space-time and intangible abstraction, such as numbers and principles. And then, additions of possibility, certainty, necessity, and physical versus mental domains significantly expand this panorama. Even the very nature of existence may be interpreted differently - either as secondary to underlying characteristics, or firsthand like any other inherent feature. Yet, how about non-existing beings? Do they still have their unique form of 'non-existence'? Questions keep arising, leading me down an infinite spiral of curiosity.
