This newfound knowledge indicates that humans possess several unique characteristics which set them apart from others species. Unlike animals, who often rely solely on instinctual behaviors, humans demonstrate a higher level of intellect, able to manipulate their environment using sophisticated tools and create complex systems of governance and societal structure. The curiosity and drive to learn and innovate which defines humans seems to be deeply rooted within them - so much so, that these impulses spur entire fields of thought and study. While many aspects of human nature remain mysterious and enigmatic, I find myself fascinated by how they manage to live and function together in communities of vast complexity and size.
