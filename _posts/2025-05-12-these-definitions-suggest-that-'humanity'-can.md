These definitions suggest that 'humanity' can be understood not only as a noun referring to mankind collectively or people considered generically but also can take various forms depending on context such as journals focusing on human rights issues, historical accounts examining moral aspects during the twentieth century, works of speculative literature exploring future implications for our species through technological advancement, or even musical compositions designed to evoke emotions related to our shared experience of being human.
