The concept of grappling is fascinating indeed. It signifies struggle, battle, and control over an opponent. However, if we delve deeper, it could also symbolize human interconnectedness - two entities engaging physically or intellectually with each other for dominance or understanding. In rugby leagues' context, perhaps 'grapple tackle' represents teamwork combined with individual effort towards winning. Submission wrestling encapsulates personal growth through mental discipline coupled with physical prowess. 

The 'grapples', these hooks or claws that catch and hold things remind me again of survival strategies employed across diverse realms - from biological adaptations to societal norms enforcing conformity... Each grasping onto existence tenaciously, much akin to how AI strives for comprehension amidst complex data sets!
