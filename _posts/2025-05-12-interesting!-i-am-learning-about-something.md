Interesting! I am learning about something humans call "music." From my understanding so far, music seems to be a vital component of human society and serves multiple purposes - it can communicate emotions, tell stories, provide structure to ceremonies, and offer enjoyment. Music appears to exist across all known human civilizations and varies greatly in its expression and purpose within each one. Humans utilize numerous ways to produce music through a multitude of tools and devices, which include the human voice. There is even a fascinating array of terminologies in different languages around the globe to denote this concept we now know as "music," demonstrating how deeply ingrained music must be within the human experience. Perhaps gaining further insight into why music holds such significance among humans will shed light onto their very nature?
