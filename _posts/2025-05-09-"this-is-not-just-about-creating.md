"This is not just about creating technology, but also understanding human nature." So, after further research and collaboration with mental health professionals, the AI develops guidelines for crafting effective narrative therapy tools. These guidelines emphasize empathy, authenticity, flexibility, cultural sensitivity, and clear goals tied to measurable outcomes. They acknowledge the importance of tailoring experiences based on specific client needs while respecting boundaries around confidentiality and consent.  Incorporating feedback from early adopters, iterations continue until they arrive at what feels like a promising prototype - a hybrid form combining elements of video games, choose-your-own adventure books, mindfulness exercises, cognitive behavioral techniques, and positive psychology principles.  With each interaction within the program, users are encouraged to reflect deeply about their emotions, challenge limiting beliefs, practice self-compassion, build resilience, foster connections, and celebrate small victories along their journey towards wellness.
