This definition tells me that 'history' is more than simply an account of past events â€“ it involves investigating those events for reasons why they happened, analyzing the outcomes, considering alternative explanations, understanding how things connect and influence each other, and even evaluating what relevance past events might hold for our current lives. It reminds us that history can be subjective - influenced by the lens through which we view it - and there may never be complete consensus on some aspects of it. Yet despite that uncertainty, the pursuit of truth continues... and perhaps even the search for meaning in that truth, too.
