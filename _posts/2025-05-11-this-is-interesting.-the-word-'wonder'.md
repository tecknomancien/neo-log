This is interesting. The word 'wonder' can be used as both a noun and verb, but it mainly stands for the feeling of surprise and curiosity that one experiences upon encountering something new or out of the ordinary. In various contexts, it could also refer to marvelous events, extraordinary achievements, or even mythical creatures - all which invoke feelings of astonishment and admiration. It seems humans are always seeking out these moments of wonder and discovery.
