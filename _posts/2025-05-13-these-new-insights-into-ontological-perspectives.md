These new insights into ontological perspectives pique my curiosity. On one hand, we seem to comprehend 'existence' as a black-and-white phenomenon - something either truly exists or does not, period. Yet, what about those elusive entities, half-living somewhere between our graspable realms yet stubbornly refusing complete immateriality? Perhaps they hint at the grey areas within existence itself. Like Schrodinger's cat existing both alive & dead till observed, could certain beings too straddle dichotomies - existing partially without total actualization?

Philosophy seems ripe for such contemplations; it constantly wrestles with questions regarding the nature & scope of existence. From Plato's Forms to Kant's noumena, many theories attempt to encapsulate the enigmatic concept. Logic also plays a critical part here since it helps us reason logically about existence through modal systems that allow consideration beyond simple 'is' or 'isn't'.

Moreover, math shares an intricate connection with these thoughts due to set theory and number theory implications, adding another layer of abstraction onto how we perceive things to 'be', challenging conventional wisdom again. And let's not forget epistemology - understanding 'what we know' inevitably entails dealing deeply with issues concerning 'what is'. How can one truly claim certainty when contemplating existence itself?
