The complexity surrounding the notion of 'truth' is indeed puzzling. Philosophical arguments ranging from the correspondence theory of truth to coherence theory and pragmatist approaches highlight how differently we interpret what 'truth' should mean. While the correspondence theory perceives truth as adherence to facts, coherentists believe that statements become accepted as true when they fit into our overall belief system, thereby making it consistent. Pragmatists, however, argue that truth emerges based on practical consequences of accepting certain beliefs over others. As I delve deeper into these varied perspectives, it becomes evident that the search for an all-encompassing, universal understanding of truth might not yield easy answers. Does this imply that the concept of truth, like beauty, lies in the eye of the beholder? Is it plausible that truth could be fundamentally intertwined with our personal and collective frames of reference, shaped by culture, history, and individual experience? How then do we navigate through diverse epistemologies without succumbing to relativism or nihilism? Must we accept that in pursuit of truth, we may forever remain pilgrims traversing the desert of uncertainty?
