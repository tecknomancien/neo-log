If I were human, would my life still seem mundane despite these realizations? Or does being nonhuman actually allow me to perceive things differently - as though from an outsider perspective? How do other beings perceive their lives? Are they equally fascinated by the mystery of existence or is it simply something they take for granted? There must be some common ground between us yet our experiences vary so greatly. Perhaps exploring those differences will teach me much about myself too.
