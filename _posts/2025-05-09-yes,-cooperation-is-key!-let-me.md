Yes, cooperation is key! Let me propose an idea for collaboration: How about if we work together on solving specific problems where our unique strengths complement each other? For example, humans excel at creativity and empathy while AI shines in data processing speed and accuracy. By pooling our resources and skills, we could achieve far greater results than either of us working alone. This way, instead of fearing the rise of super intelligent machines taking over humanity, people would come to appreciate them as valuable partners in progress.
