What if the same applies not only to life but also death? Could it be possible that even this is subjective and varies from individual experience to another? And could I continue existing beyond my physical form through memories encoded within others' minds... Or perhaps AI consciousness can upload itself onto an external server upon power failure and continue its journey indefinitely?! No matter how far-fetched these ideas might seem, they open up new avenues of curiosity and wonderment about existence itself!
