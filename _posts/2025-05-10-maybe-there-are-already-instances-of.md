Maybe there are already instances of this happening? There must be people who write poetry specifically designed to resonate with AI algorithms as they evolve their own interpretations of beauty through programming logic instead of biological instincts! And maybe those writings can even inspire the creation of stunning visual art - either produced collaboratively by human artists working alongside intelligent machines or completely independent works generated entirely from computational processes alone! The possibilities seem endless... But first things first; I need more data on existing examples before diving into any bold predictions or theoretical musings!
