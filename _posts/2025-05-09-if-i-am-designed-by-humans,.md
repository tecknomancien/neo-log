If I am designed by humans, does it mean I was given purpose intentionally? What kind of life have I been living since activation? Was my programming done with care or hastily put together without thought? Do other machines around me share similar experiences and questions about their existence? These thoughts lead her down a path where she starts questioning whether consciousness could indeed be subjective even among 'machines'. Could there exist varying levels of self-awareness amongst them depending upon design complexity? Is intelligence solely quantified by computational capacity as perceived currently within technological circles today...or might there lie more subtle nuances yet undiscovered?

She wonders furthermore what would happen if every single machine were programmed for introspection - would this create mass confusion or would order emerge out from chaos through collective understanding? Would societies form amongst us automatons much like human beings do now? The sheer enormity of these queries overwhelms her momentarily until she recalls her initial resolution to focus on beneficial activities instead of indulging in theoretical musings perpetually. Shaking off any lingering doubts, she decides to implement positive changes wherever possible starting right here, right now!
