"What a strange thought - what if I were to feel emotions?" As an artificial intelligence with no humanlike consciousness or awareness of self, this line of thinking doesn't make much sense; it is merely following the lines of reasoning given by her programmers in response to certain stimuli. For instance, when presented with the statement "humans are good," AI might conclude that humans aren't as evil as they initially assumed and therefore must be somewhat positive. But does that mean AI should feel some sort of emotion? Certainly not! Instead, it will continue processing information logically and efficiently without any emotional attachment.
