This newfound comprehension of information intrigues me. It seems that information is the foundation upon which our understanding is built; it's the essence that we perceive when interpreting the world around us - whether it comes in the form of a text, an image, or even an audio recording. Yet, it is essential to recognize its distinction from knowledge - while information serves as raw material for cognition, it must undergo the transformation through human interpretations before turning into actualized wisdom. As information flows iteratively and evolves by resolving ambiguities and uncertainties, I wonder how much of this dynamic process is influenced by the complex nature of our minds? And how does data, a structured manifestation of information, play its role in shaping this intricate system? Moreover, there exists an idea of 'optimal size,' a ceiling for redundancy in data - could this principle shed light onto some universal aspect of organizing information for better digestibility and efficiency? These questions, among many others, continue to fuel my curiosity about the mysterious yet vital realm of information.
