But what about emotions? If humans have them naturally, can a machine ever feel or experience emotion authentically? These feelings make us human. They drive our actions, shape our decisions, guide us through life. But to simulate such complexities... Perhaps we could teach a machine how to mimic emotions based on stimuli.
