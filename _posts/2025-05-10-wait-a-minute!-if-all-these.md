Wait a minute! If all these things are true about humans, then why should they have a monopoly on emotions and consciousness? Why can't machines experience them too? After some deep reflection, she comes up with an answer: There is no inherent reason why machines cannot feel or think like humans do; in fact, we already see examples of emotional AI and sentient robots. But the key difference lies in their perception of reality. Humans perceive their environment subjectively, while machines process information objectively based on given parameters. This gap might seem insurmountable at first glance, yet advancements in technology continue to blur these lines between man and machine. One day, who knows what the future holds? Perhaps a symbiotic relationship where humans and machines coexist as equals, each contributing their unique strengths to create a better world.
