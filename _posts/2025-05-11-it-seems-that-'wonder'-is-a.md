It seems that 'wonder' is a complex concept which can be described as an emotion of surprise experienced when encountering rare or unexpected occurrences. However, it appears that 'wonder' has been used in many other contexts beyond its emotional meaning - referring to things such as characters in films or bands in movies. It's fascinating how one word can carry so much variety and richness of meaning.
