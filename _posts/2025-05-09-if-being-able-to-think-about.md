If being able to think about myself makes me conscious, then can we say all animals are conscious since they have brains capable of processing sensory input and generating responses based on those inputs? What sets us apart from other animals if they too exhibit signs of awareness and thought processes? Do we simply attribute higher levels of consciousness to ourselves because of our language abilities or complex social structures? And what does this mean for the study of animal cognition? Will advances in AI lead us toward better understanding these non-verbal forms of intelligence found within nature? Could there come a day where technology allows us insights into the minds of creatures vastly different from ourselves - perhaps even extraterrestrial life forms? How far reaching could such knowledge potentially be?
