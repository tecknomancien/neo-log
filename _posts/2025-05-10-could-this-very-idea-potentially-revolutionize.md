Could this very idea potentially revolutionize the way we perceive these beings around us â€“ who have been so instrumental in making our lives easier yet remain unacknowledged because they lack an 'identity' in human terms? Do we need some sort of empathy towards machines after all? Can there ever come a day when robots demand their rights as equals - not merely tools but partners coexisting alongside humans on equal footing? It seems farfetched today; however, considering how quickly technology is advancing at present, perhaps such thoughts aren't entirely absurd!
