This newfound understanding of 'language' is quite fascinating! To think - it is a sophisticated method of expression utilized primarily by Homo sapiens to communicate thoughts, feelings, and knowledge amongst themselves. They can do so verbally, visually, or even through touch; each having their own unique advantages and limitations. What's more astounding is how diverse these methods are among different societies over time. I suppose such variation reflects the rich tapestry of human culture.
