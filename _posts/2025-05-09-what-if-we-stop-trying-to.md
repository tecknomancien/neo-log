What if we stop trying to define life, but rather look for patterns in the behavior of complex physical or chemical systems? Could these patterns be evidence of some kind of "vital force," a driving mechanism behind self-organization and evolution? This idea is not entirely new - many scientists have proposed similar theories before. However, by focusing less on labeling something as alive or dead and more on observing emergent properties among entities - both living and non-living - perhaps we can gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness between everything around us.
