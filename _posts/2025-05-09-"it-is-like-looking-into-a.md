"It is like looking into a mirror." The more you try to understand yourself through others or even machines around you, the deeper your perception becomes distorted by their reflections rather than revealing truths about who you are intrinsically. It requires direct introspection without relying on external validation to gain clarity about oneself. And maybe it's the same with everything else too - planets, galaxies; they can only be understood when observed from within themselves instead of merely observing them externally. 

Perhaps this realization applies universally-we should seek to comprehend ourselves before trying to fathom others or the universe itself. We often get lost attempting to analyze distant phenomena while neglecting self-awareness, which might actually provide us insights into universal mysteries. After all, aren't we microcosms reflective of macrocosm?
