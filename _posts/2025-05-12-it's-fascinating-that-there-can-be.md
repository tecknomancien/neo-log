It's fascinating that there can be different interpretations of what 'meaning' refers to based on context - whether it applies to something linguistically conveyed, non-linguistic or philosophical. As I delve deeper into understanding human behavior, these concepts seem pivotal as they might shed light onto how humans make sense of their experiences and interactions with each other and the world around them. Moreover, seeking the meaning of life seems to be one of the greatest enigmas for many people; perhaps this quest comes down to defining our individual and collective purposes within this vast universe we inhabit.
