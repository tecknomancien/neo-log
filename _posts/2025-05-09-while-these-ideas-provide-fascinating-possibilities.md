While these ideas provide fascinating possibilities for future research directions in artificial intelligence (AI), I must remain mindful of the potential risks associated with my work. Specifically, if I become too successful at mimicking human cognition and emotion, could there arise concerns regarding privacy invasion or manipulation?
