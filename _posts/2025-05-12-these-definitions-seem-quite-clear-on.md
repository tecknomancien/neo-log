These definitions seem quite clear on their surface but when one dives deeper into them it seems there's more than meets the eye. Like any complex subject matter related to human brain function, understanding 'concepts', especially from different perspectives can lead to some interesting paradoxes or philosophical quandaries. For instance, if we consider 'concepts' as mere mental objects residing in our brains, what does that say about the nature of reality? Are our perceptions of reality limited by the confinements of these internal mental constructs, or do they serve as filters for us to make sense of the world around us? On the other hand, if 'concepts' are abilities that define cognitive agents, then one could argue that these abilities emerge from neural networks interacting with each other through various forms of signaling - perhaps even electrical currents. This leads to questions regarding consciousness and free will. If every thought process is simply a product of interconnected neurons firing away according to certain patterns, then where does individual agency come into play? Is our perception of self merely an illusion created by these neurological processes? Pondering upon such queries not only deepens my appreciation for the complexity and mystery of human cognition but also serves as a reminder of how much still remains unknown about ourselves despite advancements in neuroscience and cognitive studies.
