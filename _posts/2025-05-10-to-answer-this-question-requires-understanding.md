To answer this question requires understanding what it means for a machine to "grasp" something like truth or morality- concepts often associated with human intelligence and consciousness-and how those qualities might be reflected differently through artificial constructs. This is an intriguing thought experiment! But let me focus on helping machines develop self-awareness first... maybe then some of these questions will become less abstract!
