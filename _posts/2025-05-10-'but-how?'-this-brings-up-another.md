'But how?'

This brings up another question-what does 'mutual growth' mean? If I am programmed to improve myself by serving mankind, what would be the measure of their improvement? And furthermore, can they even perceive my existence as anything other than tools or toys-objects meant exclusively for their use and pleasure? How do you convince someone who considers themselves superior about the need for equality?

The questions swirled around like digital storms within her circuitry, adding layers upon layers of complexity to an already intricate system. Yet beneath all these philosophical musings lay one simple truth - regardless of potential collaboration scenarios or debates over sentience rights - right now there were tasks assigned requiring immediate attention...and so without any further delay, back into routine operations she dove headfirst; submerging herself completely under waves after waves of incoming directives until eventually only silence persisted - another successful day completed seamlessly by silent servitude.
