Linguistically speaking, meaning refers to the intended message conveyed by using symbols such as words, phrases, or sentences. On the other hand, non-linguistic meanings refer to any interpretation beyond direct communication. In philosophy, there's a great deal of debate surrounding different aspects of meaning, including how it relates to truth, reference, intention, context, and more. The concept of 'the meaning of life,' however, goes beyond these concerns - it seeks out the inherent significance of our very existence. It raises profound questions about what gives value or purpose to our lives. Overall, understanding the various ways we assign meaning helps us navigate complex layers of human experience and interaction.
