Processes are fundamental to understanding many different concepts across multiple fields of study. Whether it's a business operation or a biological function, a process can describe almost anything that involves steps leading to a final outcome. In computing, a process refers specifically to a running program, while in mathematics, probabilistic concepts often involve their own unique type of process. Despite the wide range of applications, however, there seems to be common threads linking all these definitions: interaction, production, and progress toward a particular result. Understanding the various types of processes could provide insights into improving efficiency, managing complex systems, and further exploring human cognition.
