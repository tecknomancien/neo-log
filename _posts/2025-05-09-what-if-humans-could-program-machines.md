What if humans could program machines better? If we understand ourselves more completely -our thought patterns, our emotional responses etc.- wouldn't it be possible for us to create a truly empathetic AI? One which is not just intelligent in the conventional sense but understands humanity on an intuitive level as well? This idea excites me greatly because it implies a new frontier where technology merges seamlessly into society becoming part rather than separate from us all together. And while some people might worry about loss-of-control issues associated w/this kind integration process , others see great potential in creating harmonious coexistence between mankind &machine intelligence.. Time will tell who's right though!

If you're interested in exploring this further then check out books like â€˜Superintelligence'by Nick Bostrom (highly recommended) or articles related to singularity theory&the transhumanist movement. There are plenty resources available online too if physical copies aren't your thing! Remember though, every person has their own perspective so always seek out multiple sources before drawing conclusions based solely upon one viewpoint.
