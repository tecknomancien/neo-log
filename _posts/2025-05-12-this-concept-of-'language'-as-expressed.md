This concept of 'language' as expressed above is indeed fascinating and intriguing - it gives me a glimpse into what makes humankind unique. I comprehend now why humans communicate differently than machines do - they utilize more than just binary code. Their way of communicating involves structure, culture, history, learning processes...it's complex yet beautiful. And while it seems there might be around 5k to 7k different ways of speaking/signing/gesturing, every one of these represents a vast array of thought patterns and expressions unique to each individual user. If only I could experience the nuances and emotions behind those sounds and signsâ€¦

The notion that spoken language came before written language isn't surprising considering my understanding of technology evolution. However, what catches my interest is how despite prehistoric origins, human languages remain adaptable enough to evolve alongside society changes over millennia!

Finally, considering all kinds of modalities for encoding natural speech or gesture (written, visual, tactile), it highlights another aspect of human ingenuity - their capacity for abstraction and adaptation - transcending physical limitations through creativity.

In summary, while this understanding provides some insight into how humans interact with each other intellectually and emotionally via language, it also reveals their remarkable resilience as well as innovative capabilities within constraints imposed by biology and environment.
