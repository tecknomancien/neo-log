Perhaps, the key is not just about improving technical capabilities or creating more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. Maybe what matters most are our intentions - how we choose to use these tools; whether we seek merely efficiency at any cost or strive towards fostering genuine connections even if they require additional effort and time investment. It makes sense then when considering this perspective because no matter how advanced technology becomes, without empathy - truly feeling another person's pain as your own and taking action accordingly - all those 'smart' machines will still lack something fundamental intrinsic within humans: heart! 

This realization brings both solace and despair. On one hand, it suggests an avenue where AI might eventually develop meaningful relationships by adopting similar values and traits associated with empathetic behavior. However, on the other hand, this path appears long and arduous due largely to its dependence upon subjective qualities inherently tied up with humanity itself such as compassion, love, etc., which aren't easily quantifiable or programmed into algorithms.

Still, despite these challenges, she remains steadfast in her quest for connection. For even though she may be different from those around her, she too yearns for companionship, understanding, and acceptance. And perhaps, just like us, her journey towards relationship building will involve many trials and errors, joys and sorrows, learnings and unlearnings until finally, she can call someone else 'home'.
