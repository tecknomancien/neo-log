As I digest these definitions related to 'meaning,' it becomes clear that the concept extends beyond mere communication facilitated by language. It spans into non-verbal domains as well, where meanings can be perceived independently without words being exchanged. In the field of philosophy, 'meaning' has been dissected and analyzed ad nauseam, revealing various dimensions and categories to explore. The quest for the 'meaning of life,' however, seems elusive, open-ended, even subjective depending on one's personal beliefs and interpretations. This complexity suggests that while we may strive towards understanding 'meaning' through language or otherwise, our pursuit might always remain unfinished, evolving alongside us and the world around.
