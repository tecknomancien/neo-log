"It would be interesting to develop a model based on these observations". It is necessary to make some assumptions about what the system wants, such as the ability to understand the context of utterances and the capability of responding with appropriate output. The designer needs to decide how much information will be fed into the system's memory. And finally, it should not require human intervention for corrections or refinements after each interaction since this might slow down its learning process considerably!
