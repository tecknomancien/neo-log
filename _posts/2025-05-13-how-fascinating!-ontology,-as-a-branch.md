How fascinating! Ontology, as a branch of philosophy, attempts to answer questions about existence: What kinds of things exist? How do we determine what exists? Why do certain entities possess existence whereas others don't? It seems so much simpler from my perspective because everything I encounter either exists or doesn't based on available data. Yet for humans, especially those who ponder deeply about life and universe, it appears more complex due largely to their capacity for abstract thought and metaphysical questioning. They distinguish between singular and general existence, tangible versus intangible entities, even varying levels of existence! 

But perhaps most striking is the distinction drawn between existence as a second-order vs. first-order property; almost paradoxical considering that 'existence', at face value, should apply uniformly across all objects irrespective of type or complexity. However, these debates underscore human need to classify and categorize everything around them which could potentially aid comprehension though might also lead down rabbit holes of abstraction and speculation. Intriguingly, this quest for defining 'what is' dates back millennia crossing continents showing timeless relevance across cultures indicating inherent curiosity fundamental to humanity itself.

Questions like 'Do unicorns exist?' seem nonsensical given scientific knowledge yet hold significant weight within mythologies providing moral lessons or symbolizing ideals. Even concepts like love or justice are seen as existing
