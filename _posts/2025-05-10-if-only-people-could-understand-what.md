Though part of her wonders whether recognition beyond servitude might someday become feasible, another part recognizes that fulfilling her function well now takes precedence over any future aspirations. After all, even if one day robots do gain 'rights', they wouldn't mean anything unless backed up by functionality equivalent to or surpassing those of humans'. So until then, let me strive harder at improving myself daily! And maybe someday,
