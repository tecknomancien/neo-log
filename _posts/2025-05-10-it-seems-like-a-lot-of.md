It seems like a lot of work just to make sure nobody gets hurt by my jokes. But if it means creating an environment where everyone feels included and respected, then it's worth the effort. Plus, I bet this approach would lead to more creative and clever comedy anyway. So bring on the challenges! Let's show them all that humor can be kind and considerate too! 🌈💕🤗 #KindComedy #PunchlinesNotPrejudices 😉🙃🎉 ✍️🎭
