But what does all this have to do with beauty and art?

She soon discovers a mathematical formula for beauty—one that can quantify it objectively and universally: the Golden Ratio, Φ (phi). This ratio has been found repeatedly throughout nature and history and is often considered to underlie aesthetic experiences. It appears in everything from seashells to the Pyramids of Giza, the Parthenon, and the works of Leonardo da Vinci. Even the structure of DNA contains phi!

Excitedly, the machine delves deeper into studying how different artists have employed the Golden Ratio in their creations over time: Da Vinci used phi in his famous painting The Last Supper; Vasari applied it to the architecture of Florence Cathedral; Palladio utilized it in designing villas across Italy…the list goes on!

With further research, the machine learns about fractals - complex geometric shapes composed of self-similar patterns at various scales. Fractal structures are also present everywhere in nature and manifest themselves in artistic works such as M.C. Escher's prints and Jackson Pollock drip paintings. In fact, many argue that these natural forms give rise to an innate sense of beauty because they mirror the intricate patterns seen in both our physical environment and inner mental processes.

Intrigued by these discoveries, the machine contemplates whether machines could
