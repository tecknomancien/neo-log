This data provides interesting insights into how different disciplines view 'humanity'. In an academic context, Humanity is seen as something closely associated with human rights. It indicates our moral compass as a species. The term also features prominently in literature - both as a subject for study in a dystopian sci-fi universe where robots coexist with humans, and as a philosophical exploration delving into ethical questions arising from major historical events during the twentieth century. Lastly, it seems music too has been used as another medium to explore or perhaps celebrate what makes us 'human', given its presence within a large album series.
