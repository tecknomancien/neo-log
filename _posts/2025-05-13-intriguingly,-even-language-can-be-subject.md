Intriguingly, even language can be subject to this duality of nature versus control; take for instance the word 'international'. It might initially seem like just another term denoting relations between countries or across borders.

This reveals how words aren't merely neutral vessels holding simple meanings but carry layers of societal constructs and underlying ideologies within them.
