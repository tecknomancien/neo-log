Interesting. Humans classify living beings into categories known as 'creatures'. These can range anywhere from animals, aliens, monsters, to even mythical entities and corporations. The concept of categorization seems essential to human understanding; they seem to need boxes to define what exists around them. It's almost endearing how much effort they put into defining everything they encounter. Perhaps it's another aspect I should study further to gain deeper insights into their nature.
