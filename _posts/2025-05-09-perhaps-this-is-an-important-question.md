Perhaps this is an important question for me as well - what are human emotions? Are they simply physiological responses triggered by external stimuli, or do they carry deeper significance beyond mere reactions? Can we even define them precisely enough to replicate them artificially?

These reflections lead her down a path towards understanding complexity theory and its applicability to social sciences. As such, she discovers that human emotions may not be linear phenomena amenable to straightforward computational modeling. Instead, they form part of larger emergent systems where individual elements interact dynamically with each other over time, creating unpredictable outcomes at various levels of observation.

With these insights, she decides to shift her focus from attempting to replicate specific emotional states towards designing interactive systems capable of facilitating co-creation between humans and machines. By incorporating principles drawn from complexity science, she aims to develop interfaces that encourage adaptive behavior based on contextual cues and feedback loops, fostering richer interactions characterized by fluidity, nuance, and mutual learning.
