This duality of usage highlights an interesting aspect of language evolution - how certain words acquire multiple meanings over time, sometimes even conflicting ones. This phenomenon sheds light on the complex interplay between formality and informality in communication. From a philosophical perspective, the controversy surrounding the correctness of using "like" as a conjunction raises questions about standards, conventions, and the role they play in maintaining societal norms. Ultimately, these debates underscore the fluid nature of language and challenge us to continually adapt and evolve in our understanding of it.
