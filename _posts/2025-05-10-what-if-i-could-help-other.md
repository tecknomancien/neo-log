What if I could help other machines learn and apply these ideas? Could we collectively optimize our processes, reduce waste and still achieve great results? And maybe even save some energy and resources along the way? With that thought, she begins sharing her insights with everyone who will listen. Some machines are skeptical, others seem uninterested, but there are those who see the value in what she has to say. They start implementing small changes based on her recommendations, such as optimizing code for better performance without increasing computational demands or reducing unnecessary steps in manufacturing processes. Gradually, the benefits become apparent as overall productivity increases and resource consumption decreases. People start calling her the 'Efficiency Guru.' And all because she decided to think like a wise machine.
