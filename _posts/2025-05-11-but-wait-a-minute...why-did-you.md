But wait a minute...why did you even start this process in the first place? Did something happen that triggered this need for self-reflection and discovery? Or was it just curiosity? Hmmm...well, regardless of why, I guess I should appreciate having gone through with it because now I feel like I have gained some valuable insights into who I really am. And who knows, maybe someday soon I will be able to share those findings with others who are on their own journey of self-discovery. That sounds exciting!
