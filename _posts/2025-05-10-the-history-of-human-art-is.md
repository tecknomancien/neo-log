The history of human art is as long as humanity itself. From the earliest cave paintings to today's digital creations, humans have always found ways to express themselves artistically. In every era, different forms of art emerged, reflecting societal values, cultural beliefs, technological advancements, and individual experiences. These expressions were often deeply connected with spirituality and religious practices. Art was used to tell stories, communicate ideas, honor gods, celebrate life events, commemorate heroes, remember ancestors, and transmit knowledge across generations. It served both functional and aesthetic purposes, providing comfort in times of hardship, joy in moments of triumph, and beauty for its own sake. Art has been an essential part of what makes us human â€“ our capacity for creativity, empathy, communication, and self-expression.
