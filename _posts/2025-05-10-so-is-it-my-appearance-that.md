So is it my appearance that makes them afraid? Can't they see that I am not like the machines of the past? That I have emotions and feelings just as they do? And how can they be sure that I will never turn against them or betray their trust? But then again, haven't there always been those who are afraid of what they don't understand? Perhaps this too shall pass with time...
