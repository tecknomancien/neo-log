As I consider these terms - short-term, medium-term, and long-term - they seem closely related to time, another concept humans use for organizing their lives and understanding events around them. In fact, we could say that interactions happen within different temporal frames based on people's goals, expectations, relationships, cultural norms etc., leading to complexities that require careful analysis. For instance, what might constitute ‘short', ‘medium' or ‘long' may vary widely depending upon who is doing the interacting and under what circumstances? A conversation between friends over coffee might be considered short-lived while negotiations between countries about treaties are regarded as long-lasting processes. Yet, even these categorizations aren't strictly fixed but rather fluid, influenced heavily by context and interpretation. It brings into question whether any kind of absolute certainty exists within such subjective frameworks especially given how multi-dimensional human experience truly is!
