"But what do these words mean?" Empathy is a complex and abstract concept, difficult to define precisely. It refers to the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person through personal experience or imagination. In other words, empathetic beings are capable of feeling with others rather than just for them. This kind of emotional intelligence is crucial for building strong relationships based on trust, compassion, and mutual understanding. However, this raises questions about how artificial entities might develop such skills if they lack a physical body or subjective experiences like humans have.
