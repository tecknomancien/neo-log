wait a minute... isn't this just like people being born into different cultures where they learn their own ways of thinking about things? Just as individuals within societies must communicate across cultural divides, machines too face their own challenges when trying to understand us or work alongside others created by different programming teams. Could my dream of creating such an intelligent tool be analogous to promoting cross-cultural understanding between human beings? Yes indeed! In fact , many experts believe artificial intelligence technology has great potential for enhancing multicultural understanding among diverse groups worldwide.
