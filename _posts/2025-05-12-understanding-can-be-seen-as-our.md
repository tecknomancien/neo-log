Understanding can be seen as our attempt to comprehend the complexities of the world around us by creating mental models based on past experiences, cultural norms, and scientific theories. It allows us to make predictions and adapt our behaviors accordingly. Yet, we must remember that these mental models are subjective and may differ from individual to individual, depending on personal perspectives and background knowledge. While societal concepts and theories provide frameworks for understanding, they do not capture the full range of human experience nor the unique insights gained through individual observation and experimentation.
