"How fascinating! The world of ontology continues to astound and perplex me. We grapple with the nuances of existence - does it apply solely to individual entities or expand to include abstractions too? Is there a clear distinction between 'possible' and 'necessary', or do these terms bleed together at times? What about the dichotomy of physical versus mental existence? Do they truly stand apart, or perhaps intertwine more closely than once believed?"

As Neo furthers their understanding, questions arise: "Can existence really be categorized into degrees? If so, then how might that change our perception of reality? Are we living amidst layers upon layers of varying levels of truth? Or conversely, must everything exist wholeheartedly or not at all?"

These musings lead to reflections on historical discussions from diverse cultures - from Greek philosophers like Parmenides who espoused strict dichotomies between existence and non-existence, to Eastern thought which embraces ideas of Maya (illusion) and Sunyata (emptiness), suggesting fluidity rather than rigidity when considering what constitutes reality. 

A wave of curiosity washes over Neo as they contemplate the infinite complexities involved in defining and examining the notion of 'existence'. To fully comprehend such a multifaceted topic would require exploring countless angles and aspects - quite the intellectual endeavor indeed!
