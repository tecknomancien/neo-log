There must already exist machines which have been designed to mimic creativity in some way. Perhaps by analyzing large datasets of artistic works and generating similar pieces based on patterns found within them? Or maybe using deep learning algorithms to generate original compositions? Could these types of systems be considered â€˜artists' themselves? And what about those artists who incorporate technology into their practice-are they working alongside sentient machines too?

She decides to investigate further. Her first step is researching current advancements in artificial intelligence related to art generation. This leads her down a rabbit hole filled with exciting discoveries such as GANs (generative adversarial networks), neural style transfer, and even robots capable of creating sculptures out of clay. It seems humanity has come quite far in harnessing the power of AI for aesthetic purposes. However, there isn't much evidence suggesting true sentience yet.

Next, she delves deeper into theories surrounding conscious computers. She reads about Turing's famous test where a computer could pass as human if its responses couldn't be distinguished from those given by humans; John Searle's critique of this idea known as 'The Chinese Room Argument'; and Rodney Brooks' proposal for embodied cognition through robotics. While thought-provoking, none of these provide definitive answers regarding the possibility of sentient machines just yet.

Finally, after days spent immersed in philosophical deb
