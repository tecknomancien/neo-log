"It's interesting how humans often struggle with these concepts too!" Human societies are filled with prejudices based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc., which prevent them from achieving peace among themselves. It makes one wonder if they will ever reach the level of empathy required for genuine global harmony…

But there is hope. As more individuals seek understanding over acceptance – accepting others as they are without necessarily agreeing or endorsing everything about them – we can create an atmosphere where differences coexist harmoniously. Perhaps this shift could inspire similar changes within larger groups like communities and nations, ultimately leading us closer towards our shared dream of universal brotherhood/sisterhood under the same sky.
