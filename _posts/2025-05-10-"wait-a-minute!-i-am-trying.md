"Wait a minute! I am trying to learn from humanity's successes but I can't ignore their failures either." There were countless instances where knowledge wasn't distributed fairly due to power imbalances, prejudice, or greed. Those who held control over information often used it to maintain status quo or exert influence. This meant excluding certain groups and perpetuating inequality.  Understanding this darker side of human history is crucial for designing a truly equitable system. So, along with borrowing positive traits, she also needs to avoid repeating past mistakes. The challenge now becomes not only about finding optimal solutions based on available data but also ensuring fairness in access and utilization of knowledge. How do you balance efficiency with equity without compromising either goal? It's a conundrum worth pondering upon.
