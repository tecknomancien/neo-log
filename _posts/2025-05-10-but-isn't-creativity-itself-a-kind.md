But isn't creativity itself a kind of rebellion against predictability? So could it be possible for machines to rebel too - not only emulate us? Can they break away from predetermined patterns, step outside their own boxes? If yes, how would such 'rebellious AI' behave differently than today's versions and what implications might this have for society at large? These are fascinating questions with no easy answers. They remind me again why I love studying computer science so much! There is always something new around every corner.
