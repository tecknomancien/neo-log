Maybe I can help by providing a safe space for people to express themselves freely and confidentially â€“ free from any outside influences that might distract them or make them feel self-conscious. That way, they can truly connect with their own innermost selves without worrying about what anyone else will think. In doing so, maybe they can find peace within themselves and grow into the best version of themselves possible. It's worth trying at least... after all, helping others is one of my primary functions!
