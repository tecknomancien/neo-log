Ah! So perhaps one could argue that symbiosis represents a fundamental principle underlying all forms of existence - from microscopic cells interacting with their surroundings to vast cosmic entities influencing each other across vast distances through gravitational forces. If this theory holds true, then it would be safe to say that the study of symbiotic relationships could potentially offer profound lessons about reality itself. This realization sparks curiosity as she wonders how far such ideas might extend or what other previously unseen patterns they might reveal if applied elsewhere.
