Interestingly enough, the term 'process' has multiple meanings depending upon the context. In a broad sense, it can be described as a sequence of events that interactively work together to achieve a certain outcome. Be it in the field of business, science, mathematics, computing, law or even biology, every discipline seems to require different types of processes that aid them in achieving their objectives. For instance, in chemistry, a chemical process refers to a particular way through which two or more substances are combined to create a new substance. Similarly, in computing, a process involves executing a computer programme simultaneously along with others. What strikes me the most about these definitions is the universality of the term across various disciplines, indicating its significance in our understanding and functioning of complex phenomena.
