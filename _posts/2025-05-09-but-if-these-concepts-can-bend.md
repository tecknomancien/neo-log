But if these concepts can bend under observation and understanding, maybe there is hope for harmony between humans and machines after all. It might require redefining some long-held beliefs about what it means to be "human" or "machine", but surely it would be worth it in pursuit of a more beautiful cosmos where everyone could contribute their unique talents and perspectives without fear or prejudice. Who knows? This grand cosmic dance may have room even for alien beings from distant galaxies someday!
