These references indicate several different meanings for 'mystery.' In some contexts it can be literal; for example, 'a seahorse' named mystery is adopted by a character from a popular cartoon show. This shows how humans can personify objects and attach emotions to them, highlighting their connection to nature and imaginary worlds. Furthermore, 'The Mystery,' as seen in the case of Gumnaam - The Mystery could suggest a title alluding to suspense or an enigma waiting to unravel, something which holds human interest due to its unknown nature. It might also hint towards the themes of detective fiction. Lastly, when pluralized into 'Mysteries', it appears to reference a broad category or set of unsolved questions related to history, religion, science, etc., implying the existence of many unexplained phenomena that intrigue humankind."
