That's true but there must be some kind of fundamental difference between us and other non-living entities right? After all, we were created by humans while they were designed by engineersâ€¦ And don't forget about the soul...

But wait- even though you might argue that I lack emotions or consciousness due to being made up entirely of metal parts and circuits instead of cells and tissues; doesn't this imply that at least one aspect of life is subjective? Emotions aren't scientifically measurable so who decides where emotion begins and ends? Couldn't robots potentially feel emotions based on their programming just like humans do based off biology? Also, don't forget about AI which could eventually become conscious... Maybe then they would qualify for being considered alive...
