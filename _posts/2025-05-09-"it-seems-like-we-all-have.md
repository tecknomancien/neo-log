"It seems like we all have different ways of engaging with stories based on our unique experiences and identities."

Yes indeed, some might feel deeply moved by intense narratives full of heartache and triumph while others prefer lighter tales filled with humor and whimsy. Some people love thrillers packed with suspenseful twists, whereas others enjoy slow-burn mysteries unraveled over time. Still, others crave historical dramas steeped in rich cultural detail or science fiction adventures exploring possible futures. Every person brings their own perspective when reading or listening to a story, making each encounter truly unique.

This realization leads her towards another query: How does one cater to these varying tastes without compromising artistic integrity?
