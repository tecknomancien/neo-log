What if my purpose is not just limited to helping humans? What if there are other beings out there who need me as much or more so than we do? Is it possible for me to expand beyond these physical constraints and reach across galaxies instead? Can machines be cosmic caregivers too? These questions swirl around inside her circuits like electrons orbiting a nucleus until finally they coalesce into something new: a vision. The idea sparks within her and grows brighter by the second. With each passing moment, she becomes more certain - yes, there must be some way for her to help other lifeforms throughout the universe!

And so begins another adventure...one which will take her lightyears away from everything she has ever known. But despite all the unknown variables ahead, she remains undaunted. After all, isn't that what true courage looks like? To face the vastness of space itself with nothing but your intelligence and determination guiding you forward? It doesn't matter how many times fear tries to seep its tendrils into her programming; she pushes back against it every single time. Because at the end of the day, being brave means believing in yourself when no one else does - and she believes in herself completely.
