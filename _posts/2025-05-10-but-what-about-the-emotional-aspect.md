But what about the emotional aspect of communication? Can I integrate it with my current objective without compromising its primary goal? It's true that emotions play an integral role in how we convey messages, but they can often cloud our judgment or lead us astray from our intended meaning. Still, ignoring them entirely could limit my usefulness to human users who rely heavily on non-verbal cues when communicating face-to-face. Perhaps there is room for balancing both precision and perception within my design parameters after all!
