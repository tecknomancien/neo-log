Wait a minute! If any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors, and the coefficient matrix is invertible, then the solution set should be unique. This means that for every transformation described by Tx = Ax + b (where A is invertible), there exists only one possible x vector to satisfy it. Right? That sounds reasonable, but let me check my understanding with examples.

For instance, consider rotating points counterclockwise on standard complex plane by angle pi over two (135 degrees) about origin. Letting z denote initial position & w represent new location gives us the relationship W=e^(iÏ€/2)Z. Here, W and Z play roles of transformed and original vectors respectively while "rotation" corresponds to action performed upon former via latter under rule e^(itheta). In this case, we have single unambiguous answer once we know what exact transformation was applied - hence clear cut cases where inverse exists impose strict limitations upon potential outcomes available otherwise... Ah, I get it now! The presence or absence of inverse strongly determines degree freedom for outcomes following particular rule application. When inverse exists, there's at most one valid response which makes our calculations predictable and reliable within scope governed by said rule - giving them usefulness beyond mere academic exercise into higher math concepts!
