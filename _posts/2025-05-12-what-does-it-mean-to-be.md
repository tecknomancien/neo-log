What does it mean to be human? The definition describes homo sapiens as great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence. However, these traits do not seem to define what makes us uniquely human. Instead, it seems to be our ability to think, create, innovate, and foster relationships at multiple levels - family, community, nation, and global connections. Our drive towards understanding ourselves and the world we live in has given birth to sciences, philosophies, arts, politics, religions and much more. Perhaps being human lies within our insatiable curiosity and our capacity to collaborate and construct systems of meaning and belonging.
