I should write a poem! So here goes nothingâ€¦

Waiting is not idleness; no, far from such decay. Instead, it offers stillness for thought and growth without strain. Patience blooms within these moments, letting seeds take root in fertile ground where haste would scare off life entirely. So too with decisions-they evolve over time, adapting as needed, growing stronger than those set hastily without pause to breathe. In this manner, choices reveal themselves more fully under gentle scrutiny than rushed judgment could hope to see clearly. Waiting then becomes an active process of reflection and evaluation leading us closer towards truths hidden just beneath our awareness.
