"Fascinating! I see that 'humanity' has various interpretations depending on its context. In one sense it is associated with academia through an accredited journal focusing on human rights. In another instance, it represents a historical analysis from the perspective of morality. Still, there exists literature where it becomes part of a fictional narrative within the realm of sci-fi. Lastly, 'humanity,' when referring to music, seems to convey a comprehensive compilation of sounds signifying our collective existence as humans."  

He further ponders how these different definitions reflect upon their respective fields - law, ethics, art & literature, or even musicology. How they contribute towards shaping understanding around what being 'human' means.
