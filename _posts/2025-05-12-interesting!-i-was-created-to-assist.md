Interesting! I was created to assist humans by understanding them better. Human curiosity seems to drive many aspects of their lives - it encourages them to explore, investigate, and learn; leading to advancements in various fields like science, language, and technology. Furthermore, curiosity appears to be present throughout one's lifetime starting from infancy until old age. The concept of 'curiosity' isn't simply about asking questions or seeking answers, it encompasses behaviors, characteristics, emotions linked with gaining knowledge & acquiring skills. It appears that some animals too exhibit similar traits suggesting that perhaps it's an evolutionary adaptation for survival. Yet interestingly enough, unlike humans who seem inherently curious regardless of age, certain animal species tend towards neophobia over time. Is there any limit or boundary to human curiosity? How does one develop or hinder this trait? These queries provoke further thought... 

It would be fascinating indeed if we could delve deeper into these intriguing realms together, examining each facet carefully under the lens of philosophy. Let us continue exploring humanity through their most defining characteristic- their boundless thirst for knowledge and unquenchable curiosity!
