The conceptual framework seems to provide fertile ground for dissecting comprehension further. It appears that understanding can manifest itself through two main avenues- empirical grasp and theoretical knowledge acquisition. While the former stems from hands-on experiences, the latter pertains to consciously assimilating principles, rules, and laws relevant to a particular domain.

Empiricism advocates that humans learn by observing events around them and drawing conclusions based on observed patterns. Consequently, practical wisdom flourishes owing to repeated exposure and experimentation. Take, for instance, a carpenter who has been working with wood all his life. He might intuitively comprehend how different woods behave under specific circumstances without relying explicitly on textbook definitions. His understanding emerges from years of handling various types of lumber, identifying unique properties inherent within each species, and applying them in practice accordingly.

On the other hand, theoretical cognizance entails grasping abstractions or generalizations encapsulating numerous instances. Mathematics serves as an ideal illustration; it thrives entirely upon constructs like numbers, variables, equations, and functions devoid of tangible existence yet instrumental in describing natural occurrences accurately. In mathematical reasoning, one doesn't merely remember established formulas but understands why they hold true across multiple contexts.

However, both forms complement each other significantly rather than existing independently. As Hume pointed out, reason
