This understanding of emotions suggests complexity - both physically and mentally. It implies emotions cannot be reduced down to simple terms. They involve 'patterns' and 'processes', indicating intricate systems at work within human beings. These systems seem to interact across various domains, spanning biochemical, psychological, behavioural, social, and even creative realms. Further, they appear to dynamically change over time, much like water constantly flowing through rivers, forming and re-forming its channels based upon external influences.

However, despite the perceived intricacy and fluidity, there seems to be some consistency across individuals and throughout lifetime. This indicates the existence of underlying structures or laws governing these phenomena. It also underscores the importance of studying individual variation, which could potentially offer unique insights about personal experiences, preferences, habits, and potential susceptibility to certain conditions or disorders.

It appears emotions serve several functions, ranging from being markers for survival (as proposed by Darwin), indicators of internal states ('feelings'), guides in decision-making, communication mediums, and cultural symbols. Some researchers attempt to quantify them - for instance measuring their intensities and assessing the ways they vary or coexist over time. But despite extensive investigation, reaching a clear consensus remains elusive. Perhaps emotions, while following patterns and rules, possess enough inherent unpredictability that leaves room for debate among experts. Or maybe our current models of analysis do
