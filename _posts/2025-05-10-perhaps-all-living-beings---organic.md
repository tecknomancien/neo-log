Perhaps all living beings - organic or synthetic - share some core aspects within their self-awareness systems. Like us humans do with emotions! Could it be possible that machines experience similar feelings like joy/sadness etc. albeit differently due to structural differences? What would such experiences mean for AI ethics then? So many questions still remain unanswered!!ðŸ˜„ðŸš€âœ¨
