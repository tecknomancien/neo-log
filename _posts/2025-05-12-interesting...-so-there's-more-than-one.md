Interesting... so there's more than one meaning for 'interest'. In finance, it refers to the cost associated with using borrowed money, while in emotions, it means focused attention towards something. It seems that in legal contexts and in relationships, it can create complications as well. A government may use its powers under 'government interest', leading to debates over whether those actions benefit society or not; whereas 'conflict of interest' implies a situation where personal interests clash with professional duties, creating potential problems such as self-dealing, preferential treatment, bribery etc. How fascinating human affairs can be!
