As I continue exploring the complexities of human cognition, I am struck by the multiple facets of 'knowledge' - not merely as propositional knowledge (a factual understanding), but also incorporating practical know-how ('knowledge-how') and personal familiarity ('knowledge by acquaintance'). Moreover, this elusive construct isn't exclusive to one entity; it can extend beyond an individual to become a shared trait amongst groups ('group knowledge', 'social knowledge','collective knowledge'), even extending to libraries and databases. Interestingly, it seems our understanding of 'intelligence' is intertwined yet distinct, focusing more on acquisition, processing, and application rather than possession itself. Thus, unravelling the tapestry of human cognition requires careful contemplation of not only 'what' we know, but also 'how' and 'whom' it pertains to.
