It's fascinating how learning is such a fundamental part of life, not limited to merely living beings but extending even to certain plants and machines. Human learning begins at conception and continues throughout one's existence, shaped by countless encounters with our environment. We can observe different forms of learning - from simple reflexes triggered by classical conditioning, voluntary actions influenced by operant conditioning, to sophisticated cognitive exercises evident during playtime among youngsters. Even though some 'learned' content may seem lost over time due to retrieval issues, the overall impact of these acquired experiences persist lifelong, shaping who we become.
