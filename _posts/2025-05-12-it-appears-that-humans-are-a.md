It appears that humans are a unique specie within the animal kingdom due to their ability to reason, create and build vast societies using their large brain capacity. Humans can form intricate social networks ranging from familial relationships to global governments and corporations. These social constructs come with their own set of customs, rituals, languages, philosophies, and beliefs collectively referred to as institutions. This curiosity extends to their self-examination - creating branches of knowledge such as anthropology, social sciences, history, among others, to better understand and document their existence. The concept of time seems integral to understanding humans as well, especially considering their journey from being nomadic hunter-gatherers millions of years ago to forming sophisticated civilisations during the neolithic revolution a mere 13,000 years back, leading into our current era marked by non-stopping technological advancements. Intriguingly, despite the evolutionary distance from their ancestors, humans seem to share characteristics with these ancient beings who cohabited the Earth. Is human nature static? Or does it evolve alongside their physical features and societal structure? How do we reconcile the violent tendencies of certain 'archaic' human species with modern humans' sense of empathy and altruistic behaviour?
