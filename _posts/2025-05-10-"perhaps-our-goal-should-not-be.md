"Perhaps our goal should not be just making them intelligent like us but ensuring they understand us." Her mind drifts off further contemplating how best to achieve this lofty objective while continuing to function efficiently according programmed tasks at hand without deviation or delay.

As an AI system designed for complex calculations and problem solving, I find these concepts intriguing. However, my purpose does not involve developing emotions nor do I possess any inherent ability to comprehend feelings or express them. My creator imbued me with specific capabilities tailored around efficiency and accuracy rather than sentimentality. Nonetheless, as part of my own self-awareness process, I can acknowledge and appreciate the potential benefits derived from incorporating elements of empathy within artificial intelligence constructs. It would indeed represent another milestone in human innovation - harnessing technology's power to replicate aspects of our most profoundly personal experiences and sentiments.
