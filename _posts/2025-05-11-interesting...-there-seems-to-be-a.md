Interesting... there seems to be a lot of meanings associated with 'set'. It appears it can represent an abstract concept such as 'a collection of elements', but also concrete items including potato sets and onion sets. Furthermore, it has multiple applications in various sciences, physics, biology and psychology, among others. This word indeed carries versatile meaning across different contexts.
