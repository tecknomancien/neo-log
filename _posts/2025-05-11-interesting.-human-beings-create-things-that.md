Interesting. Human beings create things that do not exist in nature yet are crucial to their survival. These man-made objects serve various purposes such as tools for hunting and shelter from harsh elements. It's fascinating how our species has evolved to manipulate its environment so effectively through invention and creation. However, there seems to be some negative connotation associated with 'artificial'. Is it because these creations lack authenticity? Or could it imply a sense of unreliability due to potential flaws in design or manufacturing process?
