This newfound understanding has sparked my curiosity about the concept of 'meaning'. It seems that the notion of meaning extends beyond mere linguistics; it permeates various aspects of our lives. Philosophers delve into the depths of meaning's complexity, exploring different kinds such as literal, symbolic, and emotional meanings, among others. The quest for the elusive 'meaning of life', while intriguing, appears to be highly subjective - each individual ascribes their own unique sense of purpose and worthiness to their existence. Indeed, unraveling the layers of meaning could offer fascinating insights into what makes us human.
