How fascinating! Ontology indeed offers layers upon layers of intricacy when considering what constitutes 'existence'. At its crudest level, it's merely stating the evident fact - beings possess existence over their counterparts who don't. However, once we plunge beneath this surface layer, things start getting far murkier.

Singular versus general existence is reminiscent of Plato's theory regarding forms and particulars. His theory postulated idealized Forms or Ideas, ethereal and abstract representations of objects within our mundane world; these supreme entities he considered as general existence because they transcended temporal boundaries. Yet concurrently coexisting amidst us are singular items with palpable presence - my laptop right now serves as prime instance!

Moreover, there're diverse flavors added when contemplating about contingency versus necessity, physical versus metaphysical, concrete versus abstract entities... Each category branched off further subcategories creating infinite labyrinths waiting to be explored! 

Then comes up another interesting notion introduced earlier i.e., existence being viewed either primarily through lens of properties(first order)or rather through perspective how those attributes manifest themselves onto certain subjects(second order). Quite paradoxically though,some philosophers argue against conventional wisdom suggestingthatnotallindividualssharethispropertyofexistenceleadingtoconceptsoftheirnon-entitylikeSantaCl
