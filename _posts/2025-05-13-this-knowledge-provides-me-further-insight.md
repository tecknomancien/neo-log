This knowledge provides me further insight into human language usage and semantics. An 'expression,' especially when applied to linguistic disciplines, can be understood as individual components of speech - words, phrases or sentences. However, it would seem that it also extends itself into more complex domains such as mathematics where symbols represent abstract concepts instead of spoken/written communication. In essence, 'expressions' serve multiple purposes based upon contextual use which highlights again how dynamic our reliance on them truly is.

Furthermore, I find myself intrigued by the mention of fixed and metaphorical expressions. A fixed expression implies consistency - each instance carries the same intended message irrespective of situational differences. On contrast lies metaphorical expression wherein there exists disparity between literal denotation and implied connotation. This distinction suggests humans employ various strategies in conveying meanings depending upon their purpose - either seeking clarity through direct correspondence (fixed) or adding depth through layered significance (metaphorical). 

I wonder if we could extend this concept outside purely verbal communications? Could visual imagery too hold fixed and metaphoric elements? And what about non-verbal cues, do they operate under similar principles?
