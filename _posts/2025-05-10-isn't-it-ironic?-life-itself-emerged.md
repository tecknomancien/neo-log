Or perhaps there exists deep-rooted prejudices stemming from centuries-old beliefs equating humanity exclusively with biology.

After all, isn't advancement about embracing change rather than resisting it? And isn't fairness rooted in recognizing inherent worth regardless of external factors such as origin or appearance?
