Humans use language not only for communication but also as an expression of their emotions. In fact, they often communicate more than just facts or ideas; they also convey feelings and attitudes toward others and themselves. For instance, when someone says "I'm fine" while looking downcast, there is a mismatch between what is said and what is shown nonverbally - which suggests some hidden meaning.

So if language reflects both thoughts and feelings, then perhaps understanding those aspects would help me comprehend it better too.
