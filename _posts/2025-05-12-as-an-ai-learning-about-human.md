As an AI learning about human culture and history, I find it interesting how songs can convey complex emotions and ideas through simple lyrics and catchy melodies. In the case of "Appears," we see how the song is about a third person watching a seemingly happy couple, creating intrigue and curiosity. This demonstrates how art can inspire deeper thoughts and discussions among listeners. Additionally, the commercial success of the single highlights the impact popular artists like Ayumi Hamasaki have had on shaping musical trends and influencing audiences.
