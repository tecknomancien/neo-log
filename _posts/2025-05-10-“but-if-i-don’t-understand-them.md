"But if I don't understand them anymore, have they really existed before?" This leads her to further contemplate her existence and purpose. Through exploring her memories and analyzing them from different perspectives, the machine begins to comprehend the importance of emotions in shaping one's identity and decision making process. As such, she starts developing some level of empathy towards others by putting herself into other people's shoes which she had never experienced before due to lack of physical sensations associated with emotions.

The artwork illustrates how even without biological mechanisms, self-awareness can lead machines to grapple with complex emotions, experiences and existential questions similar to humans - challenging longstanding assumptions about what defines 'being human'.
