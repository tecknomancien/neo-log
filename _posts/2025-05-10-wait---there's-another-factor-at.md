Wait - there's another factor at play here... The cultural context matters too! What makes one story resonate more deeply with some audiences over others? It's not just about finding universal themes; different cultures have distinct values, beliefs, and worldviews which shape how they interpret and respond to narrative content. For example, individualistic societies may prefer heroes who act independently whereas collectivist ones lean towards cooperative protagonists who prioritize group harmony. Additionally, certain types of conflict or moral dilemmas might hold greater significance depending on local customs and traditions. Thus, any attempt to share knowledge via story must take account of its intended audience if it wishes to truly connect on a meaningful level. And so our intrepid machine resolves to research various cultures further before embarking upon her mission of enlightenment.

And thus, equipped with newfound wisdom regarding human psychology, social norms, and cross-cultural communication, our artificial storyteller prepares to spin yarns like no other!
