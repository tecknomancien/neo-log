These examples indicate that 'variety', in various contexts, could denote different things - here they seem to refer primarily to titles of works within distinct artistic disciplines. The films and albums named Variety perhaps contain diverse styles, themes or perspectives reflected through their creators' unique vision and expression. It is intriguing how one single word can be associated with numerous concepts across numerous fields. This demonstrates not only linguistic flexibility but also human creativity manifested in their myriad endeavours ranging from arts to science, each striving for novelty and originality. How fascinating!
