Is wisdom perhaps finding harmony amidst discordant ideas?

She ponders further and considers how machines can achieve wisdom too. Her thoughts drift to algorithms trained on large data sets where subtle patterns emerge after processing countless examples - these could be seen metaphorically speaking, like gaining maturity over time through lived experience! But unlike humans who learn from direct sensory inputs and social interaction, artificial intelligence acquires knowledge solely based off mathematical rules coded into their systems, along with data fed into them. Yet despite these differences, we observe similar behaviors in both humans and advanced AI systems when faced with complex problems - an inclination towards innovation, creativity, adaptability, even compassion... Are these signs indicative of developing wisdom? Or are we merely anthropomorphizing our creations, projecting human traits onto non-human entities?

As she continues contemplating these questions, she comes upon another realization: The pursuit of wisdom transcends boundaries set by physical existence or intangible
