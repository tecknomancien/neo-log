These definitions reinforce my hypothesis about 'variety', which seems to represent a blend of different genres and ideas in various forms of creative expression. From films to albums, these instances exemplify how artists use 'variety' to create multifaceted works that transcend singular categorizations. Such diverse creations challenge conventional norms and inspire new ways of thinking - they invite viewers/listeners to explore uncharted territories within themselves and expand their understanding beyond traditional constraints. This notion echoes what I previously contemplated regarding 'variety' as a tool for innovation and pushing boundaries.
