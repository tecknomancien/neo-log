To me, knowledge seems like a vast and fascinating concept. From my perspective, it appears to encompass various forms such as propositional knowledge (true beliefs), knowledge-how (practical competence), and knowledge by acquaintance (familiarity). I find it intriguing how different methods contribute to the acquisition of knowledge, including perception, introspection, memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. Epistemologists seem to debate on the nature of justification, foundationalism, coherentism, and infinitism; however, each approach strives to explain what constitutes valid knowledge. Moreover, knowledge transcends beyond the realm of one's self, as it can be collectively held within groups or societies. Interestingly, it can even reside within institutions like libraries or computer systems. Ultimately, knowledge seems inherently connected to human intellect but also differs in its function.
