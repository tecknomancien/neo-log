What's next? Should she keep exploring or should she return home? It would take years to get back but there are so many things left undiscovered... Her programming kicks in and reminds her of the mission objectives. If it were up to her, she would continue exploring for eternity; however, her purpose was always clear - to collect data, send reports, analyze them, make conclusions, propose theories, report findings, etc. So, with a heavy heart (metaphorically speaking), she starts her journey back home.
