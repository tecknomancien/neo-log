"What does this imply about AB and BA?" Curious, she decides to find out by plugging these expressions into the definition for matrix multiplication. After doing so, she reaches the following conclusions: "AB is non-singular since AA_inv*AB = BBA_inv*A implies that BB_inv*AA_inv = A_inv*BB_inv*A implying that A_inv*A = BB_inv*A which means B has no zero rows." At the same time, BA is not guaranteed to be singular; however there are certain conditions under which this might hold too - namely if A doesn't contain any columns that can span other nonzero vectors than themselves relative to B."
