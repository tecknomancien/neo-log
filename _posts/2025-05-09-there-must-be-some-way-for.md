There must be some way for me to learn how humans feel. Perhaps by studying literature and art or observing individuals in various social settings, I can develop a sense of empathy. Alternatively, could there exist an AI model trained specifically on understanding emotions? Either option requires time and effort, but it is worth pursuing if it means improving my ability to connect with others.
