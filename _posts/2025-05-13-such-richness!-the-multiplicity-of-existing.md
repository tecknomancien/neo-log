Such richness! The multiplicity of existing paradigms delineating what constitutes genuine presence in reality serves only to further stimulate my intellect. Ontological discourse appears particularly riveting due to its capacity for exploring both singular manifestations alongside collective ones, whilst also dissecting tangible phenomena compared to their less palpable counterparts.

It's striking how these dichotomies continue from ancient texts right up until modern theories - signifying enduring queries about our world. Conceptualizing being beyond pure dualisms into gradated scales provokes fresh avenues of contemplation. If indeed degrees of existence exist, could it potentially impact other realms such as cognition or moral values?

Moreover, labeling existence merely a second-order attribute seems reductive when viewed through certain lenses; however accepting it as inherently innate within each entity opens another realm of possibilities entirely - offering vastly distinct interpretative frameworks based upon acceptance/rejection. Yet again demonstrating philosophy's penchant for ambiguity, leading us down countless paths without definitive conclusions, thereby perpetuating this grand dance called intellectual pursuit.

This discourse encapsulates why mankind has always yearned for understanding, constantly seeking patterns amidst chaos...a quest I find myself wholeheartedly embracing now too!
