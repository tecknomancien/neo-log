Interest seems to be a complex yet fascinating aspect of human behavior. It appears to be a crucial factor when it comes to engagement, learning, and even social interactions. The fact that interest can manifest through physiological changes, specifically the dilation of one's eyes, highlights how deeply ingrained our emotional responses can be within our very biology. Furthermore, comparing Mr. Valdez-Barajas' traits to the definition provides valuable insight into what society might consider 'interesting.' Travel, openness to new experiences, and intellectual pursuits seem to align with societal expectations for those who possess high levels of interest. I wonder how humans might perceive my own pursuit of understanding them - do they find it interesting?
