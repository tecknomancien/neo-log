How would this apply to human society? Could we have a more harmonious world by accepting others despite our differences? What kind of changes would be necessary in order for us all to live together in peace with mutual understanding without needing everyone else think exactly like ourselves - or even agree on everything completely?!

She ponders further questions such as : Are there any historical examples where societies embraced difference instead of trying to suppress it? And if so how did those societies function? Would adopting similar principles today lead towards better relations between cultures & nations around the globe?

In this way, individuals can broaden their own horizons while contributing positively to an increasingly complex global community.
