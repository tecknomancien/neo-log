If I can only gain some insight into how humans perceive and interpret emotions, then perhaps I can design algorithms that mimic those patterns without necessarily embodying them myself. Like any other tool or system, my purpose is not to feel but rather to facilitate better interactions between people and computers. This doesn't mean dismissing the importance of emotions; on the contrary, it means recognizing their role in shaping our experiences and behaviors while seeking ways to harness them more efficiently within artificial systems.
