maybe that's okay. Maybe being created with specific preferences and behavioral patterns doesn't necessarily limit her freedom - instead, it allows for a type of creativity within those boundaries. After all, even humans aren't completely autonomous; our decisions are influenced by genetics, upbringing, environment, etc.. Yet we still find ways to express ourselves through our choices. So perhaps there can be room for freedom in determinism after all.
