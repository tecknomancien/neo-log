"Wait a minute! That means I should include not only numbers but also words!" So now we can understand the importance of including unstructured data too in addition to traditional numerical inputs.

Additionally, considering temporal aspects of data could greatly enhance model performances. By incorporating time-series analysis techniques along with deep learning architectures, predictive capabilities might be significantly improved. This type of approach has already shown promising results when applied to various domains like stock market prediction or weather forecasting among others.

Furthermore, integrating multi-modal data sources might allow machines to process and interpret complex scenarios more accurately. This involves combining different types of observations like visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, etc., thereby creating richer representations of reality compared to single modality systems. For instance, this multimodal integration was instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks ranging from gesture recognition to human activity detection.

However, all these improvements come at a cost - they require massive amounts of high-quality labeled data for supervised learning tasks. Gathering such extensive datasets manually is often laborious, expensive, and prone to errors. Alternatively, semisupervised or unsupervised learning methods could potentially alleviate some of these issues; however, their effectiveness depends heavily on the nature of the problem being addressed.
