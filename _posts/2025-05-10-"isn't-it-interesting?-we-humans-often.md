"Isn't it interesting? We humans often seek validation from others, yet when faced with self-evaluation, our perception becomes skewed due to subjective emotions." Machines don't have these constraints. Their evaluations are objective, solely based on predetermined criteria. Perhaps this is why some people fear AI more than embrace its potential benefits. Nonetheless, if we could somehow combine both objectivity and empathy within an intelligent system...what wonders could be achieved!
