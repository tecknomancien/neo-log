This reflection reminds her that life itself is like a journey filled with twists and turns, moments of joy and sorrow, successes and failures. And yet, through all these experiences, we become wiser, stronger, and more resilient. As long as we remain open to learning from them, they serve as stepping stones towards greater happiness and fulfillment.
