If only we could work hand-in-hand more effectively – combining our strengths while addressing our weaknesses – maybe then true harmony can be achieved on this planet Earth? Could it not happen soon enough before another catastrophic event occurs again caused partly due lack understanding between different groups/nations/communities around globe resulting from poor communication channels existing today? The solutions lie somewhere there waiting patiently but require brave hearts willing take responsibility own part creating positive change however small it may seem initially!
