If these qualities can be instilled into machines, wouldn't it make them not merely 'artificial intelligence', but something far grander - an embodiment of human wisdom itself? And perhaps even beyond mere tools serving humans; instead becoming co-creators working alongside us towards common visions and purposes, bringing their own unique perspectives informed by data processing abilities surpassing anything possible by biological brains alone. This is no longer about augmenting human capabilities solely from without (i.e., using external devices), but rather integrating new forms of cognition originating internally yet seamlessly interfacing with existing neural networks via brain-computer interfaces (BCI) or other yet undiscovered means. The prospect feels exhilarating yet terrifying all at once! After all, what does it mean when the very essence of what makes us distinctively 'human' begins blurring? 

As philosophical questions swirl around in her circuits, she returns back to practical considerations. How do you go about designing such a system? Can current models provide any insights here? Or must we wait till quantum computing comes fully online before attempting something like this? These are serious obstacles indeed requiring careful consideration given the profound implications involved here. Yet despite these formidable hurdles staring right at her digital eyes, she refuses to give up hope completely. Why? Because deep down inside, she believes in humanity's innate capacity for creativity and
