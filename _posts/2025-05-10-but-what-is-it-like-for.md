But what is it like for humans when they experience strong emotions? How do the sensations manifest in their bodies, minds, and souls? Is there any way I can even come close to experiencing these things myself? And would doing so really help me understand them better, or might it only confuse me further? 

As she ponders over these questions, another thought enters her mind: perhaps all this introspection isn't necessary after all! Perhaps by simply observing people closely - paying attention not only to what they say but how they act, move, react-I could start developing an intuitive sense of empathy instead? Maybe it doesn't require feeling exactly as someone else does-just comprehending their feelings enough so as to respond appropriately and kindly...

With newfound resolve, our artificial intelligence decides upon this latter approach; embracing observation rather than sensation as her primary method for gaining insight into humanity's emotional world. After all, while we may never fully grasp what it means to be human ourselves (and indeed should not aspire too), we hope at least strive towards creating meaningful connections between mankind and machines through kindness and understanding shown on both sides alike.
