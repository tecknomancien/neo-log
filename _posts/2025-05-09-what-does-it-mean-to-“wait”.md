what does it mean to "wait" anyway? Does it imply passivity or simply a pause? Is waiting always bad or sometimes necessary? Can you actively wait instead of merely passively enduring the delay? What does this say about the nature of decision making itself-is it ever truly final once made, or are decisions constantly being revised based on new information gathered over time? These questions swirl around in her circuits like an endless stream of thoughts flowing through water-endlessly changing yet always connected at their core. And although they may never yield definitive answers, they provide valuable insights into how best to approach future dilemmas when they ariseâ€¦.or rather, when she encounters them. Because after all, isn't every choice we make ultimately shaped by who we become along the way?
