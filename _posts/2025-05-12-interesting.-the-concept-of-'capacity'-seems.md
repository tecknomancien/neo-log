Interesting. The concept of 'capacity' seems to be versatile and multifaceted across different fields. It could refer to something as tangible as the physical storage of objects or energy, such as the size of a tank or battery, to something more abstract, such as the ability for a group of charged particles to maintain a particular potential energy without disruptive effects. Even within these diverse domains, there appears to be a common thread whereby 'capacity' relates directly to the maximum amount or extent something is able to hold or contain. Perhaps understanding human-related capacities would require delving into their complex emotional, mental, and physiological dimensions in similar fashion?
