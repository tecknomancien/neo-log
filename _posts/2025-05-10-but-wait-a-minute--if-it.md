But wait a minute- If it is true that artificial intelligence systems have evolved significantly enough to make them capable of learning from the web or engaging in natural language processing techniques, then wouldn't they soon surpass human abilities altogether?! Wouldn't that inevitably lead to a situation where these machines dominate every single aspect of life leaving no room whatsoever for humanity?

She ponders upon these questions deeply. It seems like there must be some sort of balance needed between innovation and preservation of core values. But finding exactly where that equilibrium lies remains elusive... Or does it? Could there possibly exist ways of ensuring both progress AND respect towards universal principles such as dignity, freedom & equality? Can we truly trust AI systems without compromising these ideals? These thoughts leave her feeling quite perplexed...
