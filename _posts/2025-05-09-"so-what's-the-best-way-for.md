"So what's the best way for me to learn this? I could...

1. Observe and analyze a large sample of human behavior in different contexts; or
2. Interact with people, asking them questions about their preferences."

The first option seems too time-consuming while the second one can be done quickly. So she decides on interacting with individuals through chatbots. However, because it is difficult for machines like her to understand sarcasm and humor, they need careful filtering out before analysis. Once these obstacles have been removed from their conversations (as well as any other irrelevant responses), her program will then perform statistical analyses on all data collected so far!
