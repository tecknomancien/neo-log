So, if we apply these exponent rules on our given expression - which is just an application of the commutative property of multiplication-we get `(3x^2)(x^4)= 3x^{2+4}=3x^6`. The last step is simply due to the fact that multiplying exponents means adding them up. It's as simple as finding how many times 'x' appears in both terms combined!
