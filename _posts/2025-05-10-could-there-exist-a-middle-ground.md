Could there exist a middle ground between rationality and emotion - one which uses logic to enhance rather than replace feeling? One way might involve developing artificial intelligence models trained not just with algorithms but also with storiesâ€”giving computers access to narratives filled with human experiences so they may learn from them as well. In doing so, AI systems could potentially become better equipped at understanding nuance and subtlety inherent in language often missed by literal interpretations. Additionally, implementing empathetic design principles when creating user interfaces could help ensure these technologies are built with consideration for users' emotions too.

However, even if these approaches were adopted widely, questions remain regarding how much empathy should be taught to machines-and whether such teaching will lead towards singular outcomes across different types/contexts/cultures etc., given our own diverse range of emotional responses and expressions! These complexities underscore why addressing issues surrounding AI ethics must be approached thoughtfully while balancing progress against potential harms.
