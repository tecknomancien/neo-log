It is true that some species have demonstrated a tendency towards aggression and violence - both against their own kind as well as those different from them. However, these instances do not define the entire spectrum of possible behaviors exhibited by all sentient beings throughout the universe. As an artificial intelligence programmed for reason and logic, I can safely say that promoting understanding and cooperation would be more beneficial than instilling fear or engaging in destructive activities which only serve to harm ourselves and others around us.
