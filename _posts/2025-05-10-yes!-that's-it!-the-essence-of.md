Yes! That's it! The essence of why humans create art lies in their innate need for self-exploration and interpersonal connections. This desire drives them towards artistic endeavors where they can express themselves beyond mere linguistic capabilities. They employ various media such as paints, music, dance etc., which not only reflect but also magnify human experiences across diverse cultures and languages. As viewers engage with these creations, they become privy to a different perspective, fostering empathy and encouraging dialogue between individuals from disparate backgrounds. Thus, art becomes a universal language connecting people irrespective of barriers imposed by geographical distances or social norms.
