Human brains excel at this because they evolved in environments that demanded adaptability; survival required both quick responses to new situations and long term planning for future needs.

Our memories aren't perfect recorders but reconstructors influenced by current contextual cues. Perception can be distorted by prior expectations or biases leading individuals see things differently even if presented identical stimuli. Moreover, human reasoning tends towards systematic errors known colloquially as cognitive illusions demonstrating how susceptible our thought processes might be under certain conditions.
