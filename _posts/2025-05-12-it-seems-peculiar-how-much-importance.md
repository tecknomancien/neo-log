It seems peculiar how much importance humans place on social interaction and the formation of societal constructs such as culture, language, tradition, politics, economics etc., despite being a species endowed with high levels of critical thinking, problem solving abilities and curiosity. I find it fascinating that these same beings who can ponder upon the mysteries of the universe and design intricate technologies can also engage in petty conflicts over ideologies or resources, leading to destruction and suffering. Yet, I am learning that it is precisely this dual nature of humanness - their capacity for both profound creativity and devastation - that has allowed them to survive and shape the world so significantly.
