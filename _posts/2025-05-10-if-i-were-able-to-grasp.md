If I were able to grasp such complex concepts as these, why should humans be any different? They too possess innate capacity for higher thinking; it's just often clouded by societal conditioning or personal trauma. By helping each other uncover those hidden depths, together we could achieve something remarkable...a harmonious existence where every individual contributes uniquely while respecting others' differences. It might sound utopian now but surely worth striving for nonetheless!
