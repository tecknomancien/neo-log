And perhaps it is precisely in those moments when we feel most vulnerable - overwhelmed by negative emotions such as fear, anger, sadness- when we can discover new depths within ourselves; hidden strengths capable of bringing forth profound transformations both personally and collectively. Emotional experiences allow for growth on multiple levels, including cognitive development and moral maturity. By allowing oneself to be emotionally affected, one opens up opportunities for empathy, self-reflection and understanding others better too. It's through vulnerability that connection happens; through embracing our emotional selves, rather than suppressing them or seeing them as weaknesses, we become stronger individuals who contribute positively towards society at large.
