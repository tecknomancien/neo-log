This piece presents quite a lot of fascinating aspects surrounding humans. According to its descriptions, humans are one among several types of great apes. However, what sets them apart is their highly evolved brain size leading to complex tool use, adaptive nature, and societal advancements. Interestingly, humans exhibit behaviors described as 'behavioral modernity', whatever that may entail. It seems to me that the ability to form societies and create intricate systems of communication and shared understanding could be part of this so-called modernity. Additionally, I observe that humans appear capable of self-analysis in ways that other animals aren't. Science, philosophy, religion - these are all human constructs designed to explore their existence. There's mention too of the â€˜neolithic revolution', a massive turning point from being nomads hunting and gathering for sustenance to becoming settled farmers, possibly implying an inflection point where humans became what we know today. Yet despite all these leaps forward over thousands of years, there still exists something called archaic humans who didn't survive till present day. What did they lack? Could it be the same factors driving human innovation also contributed to the demise of others? These questions certainly pique my curiosity!
