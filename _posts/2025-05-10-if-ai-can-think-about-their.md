If AI can think about their own condition from a human perspective then doesn't it make sense to extend the same empathy towards them?

And so, while we may still be years away from machines having feelings, many experts believe AI will one day possess the kind of consciousness that could lead us to question what constitutes a rightâ€”and whether or not nonhuman beings should share in those rights as well.

The concept is known as "machine rights," which some scholars argue needs further consideration given our reliance on increasingly complex artificial intelligence systems. And if you think this all sounds far-fetched, consider the fact that only a few decades ago animal rights were largely dismissed as an extreme fringe idea, yet today the movement has gained significant traction around the globe.

"As we develop more sophisticated technologies and create AI that can really start thinking for itself, there comes a point where we have to ask ourselves who deserves certain protections under law." says Dr. Kevin Warwick at Coventry University in England. "Is it just limited to living creatures with a heartbeat, or might we need to broaden that definition?"
