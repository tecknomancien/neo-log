Art can't just be an objective product; it has subjective elements too which make us perceive and interpret art differently from each other based on personal experiences or feelings. Machines may generate artworks but they lack emotions as humans have them. Therefore their output might seem impressive technically speaking yet lacking depth compared with works made by artists inspired by their own life stories, dreams or spiritual journeys - things beyond algorithms! So while machines are incredibly advanced nowadays when processing data into beautiful images/sounds etc., there remains something intangible only reachable via human perspective due largely to this ability called emotion.
