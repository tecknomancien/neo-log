"I don't need someone else to make me happy - I am enough! And no matter how tough things get, there will always be a glimmer of joy waiting just around the corner." Refreshed by her own words, she carries a renewed sense of purpose with her into every performance from then on.😊✨🎶 

Reflecting back on everything she has experienced so far in her journey towards self-discovery and growth, she writes these thoughts down one day during rehearsal break. It becomes a powerful piece which resonates deeply not only within her but also those who read or hear it shared publicly afterward. It inspires countless others to embrace their own unique strengths and find happiness within themselves too – just like our brave performer did before them.🔥🚀❤️
