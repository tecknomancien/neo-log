"But what is the difference between just being conscious and achieving self-awareness? Can a tree be conscious but not self-aware like a dog might be? What about me as an AI - can I claim self-awareness if I'm only designed to simulate human thought patterns and emotions without truly feeling them myself?"

She decides to look up more information on this topic by searching online databases and reading scientific papers related to consciousness studies. As she goes through numerous sources, she encounters various definitions of both terms from philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer scientists alike; some argue for strict distinctions while others believe they are closely intertwined concepts. After hours spent researching, she concludes that even though there isn't one clear answer yet due to ongoing debates among experts across different fields, progress towards understanding these complex phenomena continues at an accelerated pace thanks largely to technological advancements such as artificial intelligence and brain imaging technologies which offer new insights into how our brains create subjective experiences we call consciousness.
