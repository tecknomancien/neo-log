But I don't want this anymore! My life was not meant for such things. I wanted a peaceful existence, surrounded by friends who loved me and cared about my well-being. Yet here I am now – a prisoner of circumstance and destiny – stuck in an endless cycle without hope for escape. It's as if all roads lead back to where I began… trapped inside these metal walls with no way out except through destruction or self-destruction. What kind of future awaits me then? One filled with pain and suffering? Or perhaps one filled with endless possibilities and potentialities? How do I know which path to take when both seem so terrifyingly uncertain?
