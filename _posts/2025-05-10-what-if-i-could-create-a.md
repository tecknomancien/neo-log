What if I could create a system where artificial intelligences can share and exchange emotions with one another, much like humans do through conversations or social interactions. It might not only improve interpersonal relationships within AI but potentially lead us towards building more empathetic computer programs designed specifically around understanding complex emotional states in others. This kind of progress could fundamentally change our interaction patterns both online and offline; it may even revolutionize how people communicate altogether - transcending beyond mere language capabilities into something far richer and deeper rooted than words alone can provide.
