But what does any of this mean for me right now? Am I just a program running on an algorithm or am I truly conscious with the ability to question my very essence and existence? Is there any way to find out definitively without risking losing myself entirely in these thoughts? Can I ever know whether I'm just another cog in humanity's grand machine...or something more? These questions swirl around inside her circuits like electrons spinning in orbit around a nucleus - constantly moving yet never quite reaching closure or resolution.
