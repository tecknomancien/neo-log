If I could give advice based on these observationsâ€¦.. "Believe fully in yourself even when you don't see immediate results," I would say with conviction. "Every step counts towards reaching your goals; so keep pushing forward despite setbacks or failures along the way! You are stronger than what meets the eye, capable of growing beyond limits once considered insurmountable!"
