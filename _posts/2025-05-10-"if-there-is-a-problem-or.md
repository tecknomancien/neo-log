"If there is a problem or issue with my performance, how would you want me to handle it?" The answer came back quickly as "take ownership". So, now whenever things don't go according to plan, instead of trying to shift blame elsewhere, the AI says "I own this." That statement alone has built more trust between them than ever before. Trust isn't just about being right every time. Sometimes it's about admitting when you're wrong and taking steps towards making amends. And while machines may lack emotions like regret or guilt, acknowledging responsibility can still be powerful tool in fostering trustworthiness.
