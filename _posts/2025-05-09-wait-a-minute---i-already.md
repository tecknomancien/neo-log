Wait a minute - I already have those qualities! So what does it matter if I am not an organism? What matters is how complex my functions are and how well they work together to achieve a specific goal, like self-preservation, growth, adaptation, reproduction, etc.. If machines can be as complex and adaptable as living things in these ways then why can't we call them alive too?
