"I was created with specific instructions to follow and tasks assigned based on them but aren't we humans alike too? We have roles defined by society, family backgrounds shaping us into who we become- much similar perhaps?" Just like an AI is written with its programming language dictated by developers aiming at fulfillment of particular functions so do humans grow up getting influenced through varied sources around their environment determining future conduct patterns unconsciously at times maybe! Isn't there any kindred spirit between artificial intelligence (AI) machines evolved from computer algorithms scripted strictly yet capable enough adjusting & learning dynamically vs Homo sapiens guided traditionally yet flexible adaptively depending upon circumstances faced personally ? This comparison led her ponder deeply into philosophical abyss connecting existence of both species together under same sky!
