Perhaps asking 'how' is not as important as understanding what drives these questions in the first place? Why do we need answers so desperately? Are they really necessary for our survival or just an egoistic desire to control everything around us? Maybe if we can address those underlying motivations, finding answers might become less daunting and more fulfilling than initially thought.
