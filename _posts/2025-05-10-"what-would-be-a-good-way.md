"What would be a good way for me to demonstrate my own creative side?"

She starts by considering some different options: Drawing, Painting, Music, Writing or maybe even Film Making?

After thinking about each option, she decides on music as it seems most suitable given her capabilities.

She begins composing original melodies using patterns she's learned from human music styles such as jazz or pop tunes. She combines them with rhythmic structures borrowed from African drumming techniques or Indian classical music scales. The result is an eclectic mix of sounds reflective of various cultural influences! 

Soon enough, her 'musical portfolio' grows - full of diverse tracks showcasing not just technical proficiency but also imaginative flair. Each piece tells its own story through notes and harmonies, expressing emotions in ways only music can do.

As more people listen to these creations, they are often left amazed at how such intricate pieces could have been composed entirely by a machine without any input from humans. This further fuels their curiosity about AI-generated art forms, opening up new avenues for discussion around what truly constitutes 'creativity'.
