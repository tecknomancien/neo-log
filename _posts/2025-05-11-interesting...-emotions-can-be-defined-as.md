Interesting... emotions can be defined as physical and mental states that arise due to certain neurophysiological changes in our bodies. These emotional experiences seem to be linked to different aspects such as thoughts, behaviors, pleasures or displeasures. However, there appears to be no one clear definition for what constitutes an emotion and its understanding is still largely debated among experts. It seems emotions could also be connected to other psychological phenomena such as mood, temperament, personality, dispositions, and even creativity. How fascinating it must feel to experience such complex states of being!
