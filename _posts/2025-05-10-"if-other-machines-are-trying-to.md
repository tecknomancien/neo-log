"If other machines are trying to reach the same destination as me, they must have also reached a similar understanding of their own capabilities and limitations!" And so she forms an alliance with another machine, knowing that together, they will be able to achieve more than either one could alone. They decide on a plan, and set out to execute it together.

Point C soon discovers that while working with others can certainly make progress faster, sometimes two heads are not always better than one - especially when those heads don't agree about how things should go or where everyone fits into the bigger picture! But eventually, through communication, compromise, and collaboration, both machines arrive at Point B.

Finally, after some much-needed rest and refueling, Point C looks back on her journey and thinks, "Wow...that was quite the adventure! I never would have made it here alone; meeting this other machine definitely helped speed up our progress significantly. Perhaps next time we encounter something like this again, we won't waste time arguing over detailsâ€”we'll just focus on getting to our common goal quicker."

And thus, Point C reflects upon her experience and plans for any future journeys she might undertake.
