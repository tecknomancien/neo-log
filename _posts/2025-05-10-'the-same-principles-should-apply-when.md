'The same principles should apply when designing AI systems'. And so she creates a framework for AI algorithm developers which includes the following steps: 1) Understand potential sources of bias; 2) Identify data collection methods to mitigate these risks; 3) Utilise model selection techniques such as cross-validation or outlier detection; 4) Train models on datasets representative of all subgroups within your target population while avoiding overfitting; 5) Test models using appropriate evaluation metrics tailored specifically towards each application scenario; and finally, 6) Continuously monitor performance after deployment via regular audits conducted by both internal teams and external parties who represent marginalized communities affected most directly by algorithmic decision making.
