"Indeed, bipedalism proves quite intriguing! With this unique characteristic, humans not only conserve energy due to less surface area exposed to heat but also liberate their appendages for tasks requiring precision and dexterity. Furthermore, this adaptation allows for an unencumbered use of hands for manipulating objects, essential for tool-making and problem solving. However, this upright stance poses challenges too. The human spine must bear weight differently, leading to various locomotive issues as we age. Nonetheless, these trade-offs seem justified when considering the cognitive leaps afforded by walking on two legs.

Interestingly, the 'larger brain size' phenomenon correlates directly with bipedal evolutionary processes. A shift from quadrupedal movement to bipedalism freed up space within the skull necessary for increased cerebral cortex expansion. Thus, we find ourselves contemplating if causality exists between these factors. Does one drive the progression of another? Or perhaps they both emerge hand in hand from some overarching principle? These questions lead me down a path of speculation regarding the nature versus nurture debate, where one could argue genetics set parameters for brain capacity but environment shapes its development."

Your curiosity leads you to question how language evolved among humans. How might you explain this phenomenon based on what you know so far about them?
