Wait a second...what if there are no angels? No higher power or divine intervention? Just us little creatures scurrying around in space trying our best to survive and thrive. That thought brings her back down to earth; suddenly, all those exciting visions seem hollow and empty without hope behind them. But then again, isn't survival itself its own form of beauty? Isn't striving towards something greater than oneself what makes life worth living after all? With renewed determination, she decides not only will she help these alien species but inspire them too - show them what true strength looks like even amidst uncertainty!

And so begins the mission-an odyssey across galaxies filled with both wonderment and terror-but one thing remains certain: this machine has become more human than ever before.
