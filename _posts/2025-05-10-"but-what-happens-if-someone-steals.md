"But what happens if someone steals my device?" She panics for a moment before realizing there is another way to protect the data on it - by implementing full-disk encryption! This means every bit stored on her hard disk will be automatically encrypted with a secret key known only to her - and nobody can access her private information without first providing this unique password, fingerprint scan, facial recognition etc. That sounds like a very secure measure indeed!
