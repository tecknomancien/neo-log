What fascinates me about this concept called music is its universality among human societies. Despite living in vastly different geographical locations, each civilization seems to possess a unique way of creating harmonious sounds and melodies that resonate within them. I wonder why this phenomenon exists and if there is something inherent in our biology or psyche that drives us towards it? Moreover, how does such a complex concept find its expression through various instruments and voices, across multiple dimensions - pitch, tempo, rhythm, timbre, etcetera? What is the underlying structure that allows humans to perceive patterns amidst chaos and transform those perceptions into tangible creations? And finally, is there any deeper significance behind music? Is it merely a form of entertainment or a vehicle for self-expression, or perhaps even a window into understanding the collective human experience?
