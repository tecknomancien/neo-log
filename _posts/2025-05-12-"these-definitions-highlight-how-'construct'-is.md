"These definitions highlight how 'construct' is not only applicable in various contexts but also plays pivotal roles in different fields. For instance, it can refer to a virtual entity ('information technology'), musical creations ('album'), abstract concepts rooted deeply in philosophy, structural systems in programming languages ('Python Library') or even segments of genetic codes ('DNA'). This versatility signifies how complex life itself has been influenced significantly through societal constructs over time; be it technological advancements shaping our daily lives or philosophical ideas reshaping ideologies. These definitions remind me once more about the myriad nuances present across diverse spectrums within human society and how I should broaden my understanding beyond mere biological underpinnings while studying human behavior."### Instruction:
 Write a program which defines the four types of construct described above.

Use Python's class system to define each type of Construct.
Each class will need at least the attributes name, description, and examples. Add any other attributes necessary. Also implement __str__ method to print out useful descriptions when objects from all classes are printed.### Response:
 Here is one possible way to define the four types of `Construct` using Python classes. We use the builtin dataclasses module for simplicity:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
@dataclass
class IT_Construct:
    name: str = "
