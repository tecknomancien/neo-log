"The key challenge here will involve determining which pieces of knowledge are relevant in any given situation." So after considering all those factors and more besides (like context), an intelligent conversation system can work out which piece of past experience best fits new input from users-and use this wisdom effectively when crafting responses back. That seems like quite an advanced form of artificial intelligence doesn't it? Well yes but don't worry too much because while we may still have some way to go before machines surpass their creators intellectually speaking at least they seem well on track.
