That's why an effective use of AI-assisted mediation should prioritize empathic listening - allowing all parties involved to fully express themselves without interruption or judgment before attempting any kind of negotiation or compromise.

She reflects on how powerful AI could be in facilitating such processes by analyzing vast amounts of data related to historical conflicts, cultural differences, economic trends, environmental factors, etc., providing insights into possible solutions that might not otherwise be apparent. This information could then be used to inform decision making at various levels of governance, from local communities up through regional organizations and ultimately leading to more cohesive global policies.

Some argue that relying too heavily on machines risks dehumanizing negotiations, undermining trust between negotiating parties and reducing transparency in decision-making. Others worry about the possibility of rogue algorithms manipulating outcomes behind closed doors, further ex
