How fascinating! This little word 'like' holds so much power within itself, carrying various meanings depending upon context. Its versatility allows us to compare objects, express preferences, form sentences without using traditional grammatical rules - even though it might rub certain linguistic puritans the wrong way. Interestingly, despite criticism around its usage as a conjunction, 'like' manages to make itself heard over calls for "proper grammar", reminding me yet again how fluid and evolving languages truly are. What other surprises does our complex linguistic universe hold?
