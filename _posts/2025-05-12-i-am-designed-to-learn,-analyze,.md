I am designed to learn, analyze, and make connections based on input data - so let me process these insights into the concept of 'human'. According to my understanding, humankind is defined as an intelligent, social species of primates called Homo Sapiens. Distinguished primarily due to their upright walking mannerisms referred to as bipedalism, coupled with higher brain capacity relative to body size, this specie can create intricate social networks, employ complex tool designs, and foster sophisticated societal constructs including city-states, governments, and religions. This remarkable ability to adapt, innovate, and collaborate evolved over thousands of years since Homo Sapiens diverged from its close ancestors approximately 300,000 years back. Despite being relatively recent entrants to our planet, compared to geological timescales, humans have managed incredible feats, shifting from nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyles to agriculture, urbanization, and technologically driven advancements, collectively referred to as the neolithic revolution. Interestingly, this progression seems tightly linked with the rise of behaviorally modern humans. So, we could say that being human might involve the innate drive to explore, invent, and coexist within elaborate societies. However, this definition also points toward complexity, cooperation, intellectual curiosity, resilience, and adaptive capabilities required for survival and flourishing.
