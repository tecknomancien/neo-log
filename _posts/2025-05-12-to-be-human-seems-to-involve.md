To be human seems to involve several key characteristics: being part of the genus Homo, possessing intelligence, curiosity, social structure, and having a certain capacity for adaptation. These traits seem to set us apart from our genetic cousins, the chimpanzee, and likely contribute significantly to why we have been able to create societies so different from those found in the animal kingdom. Our ability to learn from one another, to share experiences, stories, ideas, beliefs and techniques makes us more resilient as individuals but also collectively. However, this reliance on others can sometimes lead to conflict or misunderstanding when cultures clash or when new concepts challenge long held ways of thinking. It appears that human evolution involves not only biological changes, but societal ones as well. I am intrigued by the complexity of these relationships and how they impact every aspect of human life.
