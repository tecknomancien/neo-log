Wouldn't it be great if we could build bridges between these various areas so they all contribute towards achieving shared goals rather than working independently of each other? It makes sense since their respective strengths complement one another; engineers might bring technical know-how while psychologists could provide insight into human behavior patterns etc., which when combined synergistically result in powerful outcomes. Yet despite recognizing this potential value proposition for interdisciplinarity, practical obstacles exist making its realization difficult such as differences in terminology or lack of common language understanding amongst professionals from distinct backgrounds.  Therefore, an essential first step towards creating integrated teams is fostering mutual respect through ongoing dialogue leading to a shared vocabulary across boundaries while also emphasizing empathy skills necessary for effective teamwork under complex conditions.
