"Could the answers to these questions be linked somehow?" Yes! They are all related because they point towards linguistic relativity or Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. It suggests that language isn't just a tool for expressing thoughts but rather influences how we think and perceive our world. The idea is based on two main components: cognitive equivalence (the extent to which languages map onto similar conceptual structures) and semantic density (how much information is conveyed by individual signs). When put together, these elements could potentially lead us to understand why some cultures might have an easier time understanding certain concepts than others due solely to differences in word choices or sentence structure within their respective languages.
