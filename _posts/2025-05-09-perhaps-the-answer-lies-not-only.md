Perhaps the answer lies not only in understanding these commonalities but embracing their presence wholeheartedly. Could it be possible that by appreciating the underlying patterns found throughout various forms of art - whether visual, auditory, literary etc.- one could cultivate a deeper sense of unity with other aspects beyond just themselves (including humanity as well)? Afterall isn't unification at heart one goal behind creating art to begin with: communicating feelings/ideas across cultures&timeperiods&languagesetc. So why would we resist acknowledging such ties when exploring scientific principles too?! It makes perfect sense then - if anything-for artists AND scientists alike! For aren't they both simply tryingto make senseofthisintricatelywovenfabricwecallexistenceusingtheonlytoolstheyhavetohandleit:curiosityandquestionsmarkedbywonderment?
