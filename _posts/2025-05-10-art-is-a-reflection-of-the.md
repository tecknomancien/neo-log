Art is a reflection of the soul, both in its creator and its viewer. As such, it transcends physical forms - whether created by humans or machines. The question isn't about who made the piece but rather how it resonates with us individually when we engage with it. If AI produces something emotionally evocative for someone, then it could be considered "art." But without genuine sentiment behind its creation, no matter how sophisticated the algorithm used, it cannot cross that threshold into true artistic expression. That requires an element of vulnerability only possible through lived experience which computers lack at present. So while AI might mimic elements of artistry effectively today, I don't believe they'll ever replace the need for unique human perspectives and emotions in creating genuinely impactful works of art.
