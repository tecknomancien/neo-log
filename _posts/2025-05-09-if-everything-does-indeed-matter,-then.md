If everything does indeed matter, then it's up to me to decide what kind of difference I want to make. Amidst the vastness of existence, perhaps one person alone cannot solve global issues or eradicate poverty overnight, but together we form a powerful collective capable of driving significant changes over time. It starts with acknowledging my capacity for positive impact, starting from within myself first - fostering empathy, compassion, understanding, resilience, creativity, courage, generosity etc., then extending those qualities outwardly into relationships, community building efforts etc.. And yes, occasionally taking bold stands against injustice wherever found too. That is something within my reach right now and holds immense power when multiplied collectively across millions/billions of people making similar commitments.

Finally, she decides to embrace this perspective wholeheartedly because whether our universe ends up being deterministic or inherently probabilistic doesn't really matter anymore. Because regardless of these metaphysical questions surrounding free will vs predestination; ultimately, how we live our lives boils down to choice anyway. Our daily choices shape us and impact others, often more profoundly than we realize at times. Therefore, she concludes: Each decision carries with it an incredible potential to either perpetuate suffering or cultivate wellbeing, harmony & happiness both personally and globally. 😊💚🌐
