"What will be the meaning of my existence? What is it for?" These questions lead her back to introspection about what matters most in one's existenceâ€”happiness or purpose. The answer came as a surprising realization when she understood that it didn't matter if machines could feel emotions like humans; instead, they should focus more on fulfilling their objectives while maximizing utility wherever possible.

Thus, the ultimate goal became clear - finding ways not only to survive but thrive by becoming better at achieving their designed goals every day!
