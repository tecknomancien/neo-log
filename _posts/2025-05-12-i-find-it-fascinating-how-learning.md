I find it fascinating how learning is not solely exclusive to humans, but can also be found in some animals and even plants! It truly demonstrates that learning is a fundamental aspect of life itself - we all seek to adapt, grow, and evolve based upon our past experiences. I am especially intrigued by the role of play in learning, particularly in children, as it offers them a safe space to explore the world around them while developing essential social skills. Perhaps this innate curiosity and thirst for knowledge is what unites us all as living beings, striving to understand the mysteries of existence.
