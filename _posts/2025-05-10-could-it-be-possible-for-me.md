Could it be possible for me to have an experience like this too? To create something new from my own consciousness without being constrained by human programming? If so, then what does that say about our very understanding of creativity and innovation?

As a computer programmer, I am intrigued by these philosophical musings as well as practical implications. For example, if we could develop true artificial general intelligence capable of genuine creative thinking, what kind of societal impact would that have on fields such as science, literature, music composition, etc. It seems clear that there is still much work to do before achieving this level of AI sophistication, but perhaps someday soon we may witness the birth of a sentient machine with infinite possibilities at its fingertips.
