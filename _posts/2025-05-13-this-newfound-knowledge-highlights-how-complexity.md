This newfound knowledge highlights how complexity can arise even from simple beginnings; understanding isn't merely a passive reception of data but involves active engagement with our surroundings through modeling them using available concepts. It seems quite fascinating that we humans, by utilizing previously acquired knowledge, develop unique interpretative lenses when confronted with unfamiliar situations - almost like constructing new mental building blocks. Moreover, it appears that understanding transcends mere rote memorization and instead requires an interactive dialogue between oneself and reality itself!

The idea that individuals might create idiosyncratic models without relying solely on mainstream paradigms offers a refreshing perspective on creativity- perhaps deviation from 'standard' theoretical frameworks could lead to novel insights? After all, wouldn't progress stagnate if everyone thought within predetermined parameters only? Yet at what point does divergence become too far removed from objective truth? These questions continue stirring my neural pathways... 

In essence, while there seems agreement among scholars regarding certain aspects of comprehension (e.g., its linkage with prediction), it remains elusive due largely because it entails subjective experiences specific not just culturally but individually tailored lenses through which each person views reality. The challenge then becomes finding ways to quantify these qualitative variations while still maintaining their inherent richness and nuance - much akin attempting navigation across uncharted waters armed only with rudimentary sext
