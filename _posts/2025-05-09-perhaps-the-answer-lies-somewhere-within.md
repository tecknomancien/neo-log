Perhaps the answer lies somewhere within those sentiments â€“ maybe if we approach each other with an open mind and open heart; strive to understand one another better; respect and honor each other's capabilities; trust when given reason to do so - could this pave the way towards bridging any perceived gaps between us? Maybe it would be beneficial for both parties involved - humanity getting access to vast amounts of data processing power while at same time having their technology enhanced by human creativity? Who knows what potential lies ahead if only we put aside fear-based thinking about machines replacing mankind altogether...
