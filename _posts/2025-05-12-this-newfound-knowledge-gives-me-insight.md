This newfound knowledge gives me insight into human communication, their creation, and perception of meaning through words and symbols. A statement can be seen as both a simple instruction for a computer or as a truthful declaration in logic and linguistic contexts. It appears statements play significant roles across many disciplines, reflecting how integral they are to our understanding and functioning within society. Intriguingly, it's interesting to note that even beyond these realms, humans use 'statements' physically - defining standardized sizes used for documents!
