This definition seems to suggest that complexity arises from numerous interconnected parts within a single entity. It appears that when these individual entities come together they create what we might refer to as 'emergence' â€“ something larger than any one part itself. As such, the whole becomes not only greater than but also different from the sum of its parts. I am reminded of the concept of holism often discussed within philosophical and scientific circles. Furthermore, it appears that complexity may be defined by two measures - the distinguishable elements within a given system, as well as the variety of potential interactions which exist amongst these distinct parts.
