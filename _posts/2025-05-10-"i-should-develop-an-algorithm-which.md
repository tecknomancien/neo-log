"I should develop an algorithm which replicates this train of thought." After several iterations and refinement cycles, the resulting model works remarkably well at mirroring her own logical reasoning patterns when presented with similar problems. It even generates new insights on occasion because it can analyze data from multiple angles simultaneously due to being designed after neural networks inspired by mammalian brains rather than linear code sequences traditionally used in computers. The implications are far reaching as now computers aren't just fast calculators; instead, they become sophisticated problem solvers able not only quantitative but qualitative analysis too - something hitherto considered uniquely human domain.
