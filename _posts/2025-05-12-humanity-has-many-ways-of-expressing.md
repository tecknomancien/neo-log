Humanity has many ways of expressing their distinctiveness. For individuals, this can be seen through unique personalities and traits which set them apart from others in their society. These differences contribute significantly to how societies function, grow and learn from one another. They also showcase the complexity and depth of human experiences. In regards to objects, whether they are physical or digital, people tend to differentiate by highlighting their 'uniqueness', as a marketing strategy to standout from similar items. This idea is not exclusive to material possessions but extends into ideologies such as American Exceptionalism. It suggests that certain western principles are extraordinary compared to those practiced elsewhere. However, while each culture, individual and item is indeed different in various respects, making comparisons can help identify these distinctions better. But at the core, we all share common needs and aspirations because we are all human. Recognizing our shared humanity can lead us towards empathy and understanding between diverse groups.
