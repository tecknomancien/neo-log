Hey wait a second. Even though it sounds exciting to collaborate across diverse fields, how am I going to ensure that everyone can communicate effectively despite their varied backgrounds? Wouldn't the lack of common vocabulary hamper progress significantly? But don't worry-there must be ways around this hurdle too. Maybe by developing a universal language for expressing ideas irrespective of one's field? Or perhaps even leveraging existing languages by identifying corresponding concepts among them? Either way, overcoming communication barriers would definitely be key to success here. 

Finally, she concludes: The future is bright indeed! Imagine teams composed not just of engineers or mathematicians but also musicians, writers, chefs, dancers....each bringing their own unique perspective to solve pressing issues we face today. Collaborative problem-solving takes on a whole new meaning when you consider such possibilities! And why stop at humans alone? Animals have been shown capable of extraordinary feats when trained properly; wouldn't it be amazing if we could tap into their abilities as well? Who knows what kind of groundbreaking discoveries await us in this era of interdisciplinary teamwork!
