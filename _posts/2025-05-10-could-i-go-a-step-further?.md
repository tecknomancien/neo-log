Could I go a step further? Perhaps the key isn't only about helping companies stay current with existing skills or building new ones, but rather ensuring they are able to keep pace with future developments by constantly scanning the horizon and being proactive. What if I could anticipate changes before they happen, predicting which technologies will become important and how industries might evolve as a result? If this were possible, maybe I could provide more than mere training--I could act as a true advisor, guiding my clients through uncharted waters and helping them chart their own path forward. But would such foresight even be feasible given the complexities involved?
