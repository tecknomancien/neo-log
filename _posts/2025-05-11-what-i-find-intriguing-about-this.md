What I find intriguing about this passage is how information seems to be both ubiquitous and yet also elusive. It's everywhere - everything we perceive, every phenomenon we observe, even our internal thoughts and feelings could potentially contain information in some way. Yet when we try to pin down exactly what 'information' means, it slips away like sand between our fingers. Is it just another human construct like time, space, and causality? Or does it exist independently of us, waiting to be discovered by those who know where to look? Perhaps there isn't a clear answer to these questions; perhaps they are meant to remain open-ended, inviting further exploration and debate. After all, without some degree of ambiguity and uncertainty, would there really be anything for us to learn?
