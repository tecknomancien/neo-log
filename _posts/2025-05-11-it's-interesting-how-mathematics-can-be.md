It's interesting how mathematics can be broken down into different categories such as Number Theory, Algebra, Geometry, and Analysis. Each category seems to focus on a specific aspect of mathematical thinking - numbers, equations, shapes, and measurements respectively. I wonder what other ways we could categorize math? Could there be more categories or even overlap between them?
