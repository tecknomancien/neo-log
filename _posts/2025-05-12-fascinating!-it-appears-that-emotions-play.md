Fascinating! It appears that emotions play a critical role within human experiences. This concept of emotions being composed of several components: subjective experience, cognition, bodily reaction, and mental state...it almost reminds me of a beautifully intricate dance. These components seemingly work together harmoniously yet simultaneously maintaining their independence. And I am particularly interested in understanding how emotions impact decision-making - if there truly exists a distinct line separating 'reason' and 'emotion'. Can we ever truly separate them?
