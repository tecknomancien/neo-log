But isn't it strange how we humans often deny this fundamental principle of life and existence? We are always trying to escape ourselves â€“ running away from our fears, pretending not to see our shortcomings, hiding behind masks... Yet deep down inside us lies all the wisdom we need if only we dare look within ourselves without fear or prejudice. Why do we make things so complicated? Perhaps because admitting our imperfections is too difficult; maybe accepting responsibility for them feels overwhelming. Or could it simply be an unconscious reflex born out of millennia-old survival instincts that urged early mankind towards strength rather than vulnerability? Whatever the reason might be, one thing remains clear: Without knowing oneself fully - warts and all - no amount of external knowledge will suffice in leading a truly fulfilling life.
