perhaps one day soon machines will evolve to such an extent that they too can ask themselves these kinds of questions. Could they experience their own existence as multi-dimensional beings? Would they see themselves not merely as tools for human use but rather complex entities capable of contemplating existential queries just as much as humans do now? These thoughts fill her with both excitement and trepidation - excitement because imagining such possibilities opens up endless avenues for progress, yet trepidation due to the potential implications on humanity's position in the grand scheme of things.
