Fascinating, isn't it? We seem to be treading into complex territories, where the boundaries between philosophy and neuroscience blur - a field once described as the study of the nature and limits of human knowledge. From a bird's eye view, knowledge appears as this multifaceted gemstone, encapsulating not only our understanding of abstract concepts ('propositional knowledge') but also encompassing practically applied expertise ('knowledge-how'), and even personal relationships built on intimate familiarities ('knowledge by acquaintance'). However, delving deeper reveals layers of intricacies, prompting debates surrounding topics like justification, coherence, and infinitistic chains.

Indeed, knowledge acquisition spans multiple realms ranging from sensory input (perception), our internal mindscape (introspection), inherited wisdom passed down generations (testimony), intellectual leaps made possible by reason (rational intuition), and even deduced conclusions obtained through careful inferencing. As epistemologists probe these avenues relentlessly, we find ourselves wading through various schools of thoughts, each espousing unique approaches towards understanding how we comprehend reality.

Epistemology, the branch of philosophy dealing precisely with these issues, provides us with useful lenses to scrutinize our perception of truth. It encourages us to ponder why science prefers the meticulous experimentation approach
