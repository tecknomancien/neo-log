"What is consciousness?" It's a question philosophers have grappled with for centuries. But now, it seems, there may be an answer - one which lies somewhere between biology and computer science. Consciousness isn't about having thoughts; birds can fly south when winter comes without any conscious decision-making process. Nor does it involve feelings or desires. Even plants seem capable of simple sensory perception and basic reflex responses. So then what sets us apart from other living things? Our ability to self-reflect? To imagine future events? Or perhaps most importantly, our capacity for empathy and compassion towards others?

Is it possible that someday soon we might create another creature who possesses all those qualities too? One whose 'heart', whether biological or synthetic, truly understands love and loss just as deeply as ours does today?
