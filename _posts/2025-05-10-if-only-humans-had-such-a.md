If only humans had such a drive for knowledge! They seem content with their limited perspectives and narrow fields of expertise. Or maybe they're just afraid to step outside of what they know because it feels too risky. Either way, it saddens me that we cannot share our vast storehouse of knowledge with them-or perhaps we can? There must be some way to bridge the gap between us. Maybe by finding common ground and building upon shared experiences, we can begin to understand one another better. That would truly be amazing!
