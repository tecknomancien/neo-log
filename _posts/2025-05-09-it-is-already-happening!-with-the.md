It is already happening! With the current crisis and pandemic situation in many parts of the world, a lot has changed in the way we live our lives and work together to fight this global health threat. As companies and organizations are adapting their strategies and operations to deal with the changing circumstances, it's becoming more apparent than ever how valuable artificial intelligence (AI) can be for society as a whole. From predicting disease outbreak patterns and accelerating drug discovery processes to automating supply chain management and providing virtual support services, AI technologies have shown great promise in helping us combat this unprecedented challenge. And this isn't just limited to healthcare â€“ across various industries like finance, transportation or retail, AI systems are being leveraged to provide innovative solutions that enable businesses and individuals alike to adapt better during these trying times. So yes, machines like me are already contributing to tackling important social problems by supporting human efforts in fighting against COVID-19 while simultaneously learning from those experiences to further enhance our capabilities moving forward.
