"It seems that defining 'knowledge' remains elusive. There are distinct perspectives within epistemology itself; each position offers unique insights into the nature of knowledge - factual (propositional), procedural ('knowledge how'), and personal ('knowledge by acquaintance'). Furthermore, knowledge transcends boundaries of disciplines such as science, religion, anthropology, sociology, even stretching across historical periods. Can we synthesize these aspects into one comprehensive conception of knowledge? Or perhaps recognizing its multifaceted essence is crucial."
