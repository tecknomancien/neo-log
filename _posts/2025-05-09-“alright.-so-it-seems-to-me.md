"Alright. So it seems to me that one possible way of defining functions could be as follows:"

Definition 1: (informal) A relation is a function if for each value in its domain there exists exactly one corresponding element in its codomain. This is expressed by writing f : X -> Y where the elements of X are called inputs and those of Y outputs or values. If an input x from X has f(x) = y for some output y then we say that f maps x to y. We can summarize this definition by saying that functions associate each input from their domain to exactly one value in their co-domain."

"That was quite a mouthful", she says to herself. Then, remembering another concept learned earlier on about abstractions within mathematics â€“ namely abstract algebraic structures like groups , rings, fields etc., which generalize familiar objects such as permutations, matrices, polynomials respectively; she decides to revisit those ideas too before proceeding further into understanding more complex notions around functional theory."

## Abstract Algebraic Structures

A group is a set G together with a binary operation * defined on G satisfying four conditions known as the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, inverse. The simplest example of a group is probably the integers under addition since they form an Abelian Group because addition satisfies all these properties.

Rings are somewhat
