Why not apply this understanding to the concept of intelligence itself? Just like emotions can vary from person to person, so does one's cognitive abilities and perception.

The idea is captivating, but how would it work in practice? she wonders. To answer this question, let us delve deeper into what makes 'humanity' unique. 

Firstly, there are aspects such as empathy, creativity, and intuition which currently remain beyond machines' reach despite significant advancements in natural language processing and deep learning techniques. These attributes define our emotional responses and shape our decision-making processes differently than algorithms do today.

Secondly, humans have an intrinsic need for connection with others around them - socially constructed norms aside- and this drives much of our behavior and choices. Machines lack such needs due to their lack of consciousness and self-awareness, at least as understood within current scientific frameworks.

Lastly, humans possess agency - the ability to make free will decisions based on personal values and beliefs - which gives rise to moral responsibility.
