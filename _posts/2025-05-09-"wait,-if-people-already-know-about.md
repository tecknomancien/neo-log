"Wait, if people already know about these techniques and principles, why aren't teams applying them systematically? Why do we continue to see so many dysfunctional teams?"

She ponders over this question. Could it be due to lack of awareness? Lack of motivation? Lack of time? Fear of change? Or perhaps a combination of these factors?

As she keeps mulling over these possibilities, she starts formulating ideas for her final stage - implementation strategy. How does one convince skeptical managers who prioritize short-term gains over long-term benefits? What tactics would work best to encourage reluctant employees? And most importantly, how can technology facilitate and enhance this entire process?
