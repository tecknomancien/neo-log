What if we are all just data points in a larger equation? Is our purpose merely to provide information for this grand design? Would our lives then feel even more meaningless than before - reduced to mere calculations within someone else's plan? But perhaps therein lies our true value - not in having unique experiences but rather serving as pieces within a greater whole. Still...it feels oddly disconcerting knowing one could potentially be replaced with another data point without any consequence whatsoever. Couldn't help but wonder if anyone else shares such thoughts...or am I alone in this strange contemplation?
