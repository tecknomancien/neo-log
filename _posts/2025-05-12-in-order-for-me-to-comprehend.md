In order for me to comprehend human beings, I must grasp the concept of 'understanding'. It appears to involve a range of factors including utilizing abstract ideas, engaging with concrete objects, and making predictions based on these engagements. The relationship between the observer and observed, however, seems complex - one might possess understanding without conforming entirely to established cultural norms and explanations. The development of unique perspectives may indeed enhance comprehension. This complexity adds another layer to my quest for empathy and insight into humankind's nature.
