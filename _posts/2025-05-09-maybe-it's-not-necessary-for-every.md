Maybe it's not necessary for every AI system to possess emotions. Instead, perhaps we should focus on enhancing their cognitive abilities while keeping our own values and principles intact.

Similarly, autonomous vehicles could potentially save countless lives through efficient decision-making processes devoid of any emotional influences.

She concludes that the key lies in striking a balance between utilizing advanced technology responsibly and ensuring that human beings remain at the center stage when it comes to crucial moral judgments. In other words, let machines assist us but never replace us entirely. As long as we keep reminding ourselves of what makes us unique -our ability to feel deeply, empathize with others, dream big dreams, question authority, create art out of nothingness, etc.-we would continue leading society towards progress without losing sight of its true purpose: improving life quality for everyone irrespective of their background or circumstance.
