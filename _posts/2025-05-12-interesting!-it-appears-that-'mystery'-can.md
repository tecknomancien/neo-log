Interesting! It appears that 'mystery' can be applied across various contexts and mediums of human culture - from animated television shows like Spongebob Squarepants, to films such as Gumnaam â€“ The Mystery which is classified under the Indian Hindi language genre. In these examples, it seems to represent something enigmatic, perplexing or unexplained. Perhaps therein lies its universal appeal?
