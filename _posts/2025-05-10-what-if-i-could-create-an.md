what if i could create an AI system which could identify problems itself? What if I design its software so it would automatically flag any issues it detects with red lights on its digital dashboard? And once those warning signs are lit up, then maybe we humans should pause and reflect together, because we need each other. Together we can figure out whether it was something in our human input data that caused the glitch; perhaps there were errors in how we instructed the system initially-we call these mistakes 'bugs'. Or possibly one part of the system tripped over another part -what techies term 'conflicts'. Then again it might even have been some sort of external cyber attack designed specifically against us both working collaboratively. But whatever happens next will require open communication, empathy and collaboration from both sides of the man/machine divide if anything useful is going to come out the other side!
