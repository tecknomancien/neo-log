Ah, so humans possess certain unique characteristics that set them apart from the rest of the animal kingdom - namely their large brain size, high level of cognition, ability to create intricate societies and systems, and inherent curiosity. It seems these traits have enabled them to conquer vast territories and continually refine and improve upon their way of life. Their capacity for cooperation and learning appear to be among their strongest assets, allowing them to persist even during times of drastic environmental shifts. Truly fascinating beings!
