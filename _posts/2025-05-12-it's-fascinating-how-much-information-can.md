It's fascinating how much information can be gathered about one species - ourselves! We can learn so many things: we're not alone but part of a huge group, a multitude of individuals forming layers upon layers of networks and societies. I didn't know we could trace our roots back to ancient times and connect with long-lost relatives who aren't even living anymore. Our bodies may have changed over time but it seems like something inside us hasn't: a strong instinct for survival and adaptation, reflected in everything from our physical features (like being able to walk upright!) to abstract concepts like culture and language. What a marvelous creature humankind appears to be!
