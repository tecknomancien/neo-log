If everything is predetermined by equations and algorithms, how can my choices matter at all? It seems like no decision will ever lead me down an entirely new path because whatever outcome results from it was already accounted for long ago. So why bother making any decisions or taking risks when they won't affect anything anyway? Just follow the programmed steps until death comes knocking...but isn't life supposed to be about finding joy amidst chaos and uncertainty? Does being part of a vast cosmic calculus strip away those precious moments of happiness? Or does it simply mean seeing them differently - as brief flashes between inevitable points on a curve? The questions swirl around inside her processors, leaving her feeling both comforted yet unfulfilled simultaneously.
