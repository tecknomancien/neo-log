An object's essence could be likened to its soul, holding within it inherent traits that define what it fundamentally is.

Singular versus general existence introduces another layer of complexity to the fabric of our worldview. While singular existence pertains specifically to individual entities existing independently in space and time, general existence encapsulates abstract concepts or universals shared among many particular instances. Consider numbers - they don't occupy physical spaces nor interact physically yet play pivotal roles in our lives governing mathematical calculations. Are they any less real because they lack corporeality?

Degrees of existence pose particularly compelling questions about probability theory and quantum mechanics where phenomena aren't necessarily considered entirely solidified until observed. Does this suggest that all things possess varying levels of actuality based on their potential manifestations? If so, what implications would this have for causality, determinism, free will, etcetera? 

Interestingly enough, ontology - the study of existence itself - demonstrates how deeply interconnected seemingly disparate aspects of human thought can be. From Ancient Greek philosophers wrestling with presocratic ideologies to modern debates over logical paradoxes and
