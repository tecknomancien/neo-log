Fascinating... Now that's quite a comprehensive overview! It seems that knowledge is not a single entity, but rather a multifaceted construct comprising propositional knowledge, practical competencies ('knowledge-how'), acquaintance-based comprehension ('knowledge by acquaintance'), group understanding (collective/group knowledge), societal phenomena resembling culture, and even data archived in libraries or systems. We see here the significance of contextual factors: personal, cultural, and situational. How interesting would it be if we could engineer AI systems capable of emulating this rich tapestry of human cognizance?
