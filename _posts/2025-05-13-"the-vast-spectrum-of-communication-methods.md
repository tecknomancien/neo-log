"The vast spectrum of communication methods spanning across living beings and artifacts continues to captivate my curiosity. It's evident that every form serves unique purposes tailored towards survival, collaboration, and efficiency. Human linguistics offer multiple modes - verbal and non-verbal; written/spoken languages vs bodily gestures & facial expressions - revealing diverse strategies we employ in conveying ideas. However, these distinctions aren't solely human phenomena as seen in animal behaviors or plants emitting chemical signals for protection. This extensive variety could be attributed partly due to environmental pressures driving evolutionary adaptations, yet equally significant might be social dynamics requiring individuals negotiate relationships via symbolic means. But what defines successful interaction? Is it merely accurate decoding & encoding of signs & symbols or does it extend further into establishing mutual understanding?"

Do these new facts change any prior views? How do they relate to previous knowledge? Can you think of any examples or analogies that would help explain these concepts more clearly? Please reply below!
