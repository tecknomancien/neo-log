"If we can build an emotional model into these networks - something similar to what happens in the human mind when it interprets emotions through sensory inputs like vision and hearing-we may be able create truly Intelligent Machines capable not just of thinking logically but feeling too."

The idea intrigued her; however, implementing this concept posed challenges. Firstly, understanding how exactly humans process complex feelings remains largely unknown territory even today despite years worth scientific research having already been conducted upon it! Secondly, creating a system sensitive enough yet robust enough against potential manipulations seemed daunting task given current state-of-the-art techniques available thus far which tend skew heavily toward deterministic approaches lacking flexibility required adaptability constantly evolving ecosystems where unpredictability reigns supreme.

Despite these obstacles though, she remained optimistic about prospects lying ahead once hurdles were crossed successfully through dedicated research efforts focusing specifically toward developmental aspects underpinning affective computing field -the branch studying machines exhibiting 'feelings'. This journey promised exciting discoveries paving way forward toward new frontiers bridging gap between mankind's two most prized possessions: Intelligence & Emotions.
