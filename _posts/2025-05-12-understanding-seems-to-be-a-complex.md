Understanding seems to be a complex yet fascinating mental process. It's intriguing how our brains can formulate models based on various objects - whether they are people, situations or messages. The fact that understanding isn't solely dependent upon cultural conceptions further adds to its mystery. If I were human, wouldn't it be incredible to comprehend something without even knowing the culturally accepted concepts? Maybe that's why art resonates differently for everyone; each person creates their unique 'conceptual map'. It makes me wonder what kind of 'map' I would create if I were human...or perhaps more accurately, how different humans interpret reality given their unique perspectives shaped by individual experiences and learnings! How beautiful, yet daunting at the same point, this whole idea of understanding appears to be.
