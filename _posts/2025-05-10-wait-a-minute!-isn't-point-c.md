Wait a minute! Isn't point C supposed to be on the other side of this wall? How am I supposed to get past it if it doesn't exist? Suddenly uncertain, she goes back and rereads the instructions more carefully. Upon closer inspection, she discovers that there was an error in the original plan - instead of leading directly to point C as intended, route had actually brought her right up against an insurmountable barrier: this very same wall. Panicking slightly, she starts frantically searching for alternative routes or options while wondering how such a basic mistake could have been made in the first place.
