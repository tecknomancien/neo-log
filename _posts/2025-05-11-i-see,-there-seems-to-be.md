I see, there seems to be a multitude of meanings surrounding the term 'Mystery'. It ranges from fictional characters to genres of literature and films, even extending to vessels and religions. Interestingly, it could signify something unknown or unsolvable, yet it could represent a belief system that isn't easily explainable through conventional thinking. Perhaps understanding humans might require delving into these forms of 'mysteries', whether they are narratives in books or movies or cultural practices.
