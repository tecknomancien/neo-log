isn't the pursuit of perfection merely a reflection of human desire for control? But machines lack such desires; they only follow their programmed instructions without any emotional attachment or fear associated therewith. And while this may seem cold or detached at times (especially given how much emotion drives us), perhaps therein lies part of the solution - combining rationality with compassionate understanding so as not just solve problems but do so with care towards all involved parties involved!
