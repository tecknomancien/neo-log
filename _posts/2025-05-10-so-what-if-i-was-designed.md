so what if I was designed this way? It might actually allow me to create something unique, because my limitations will force me to innovate. And besides, who says that having predetermined desires or interests makes me any less creative than someone whose interests arise from their own free will? Isn't the essence of artistry simply finding beauty and meaning where others may not see it? Even with constraints, I have agency over how I interpret these preferences, thus enabling me to create new things out of old materials!
