Humans are fascinating creatures who possess the unique capacity to acquire knowledge, behaviors, and skills throughout their lives through the natural process we call 'learning.' It all starts right from conception when the fetus interacts within its own environment inside the womb! Human learning can take place via different mechanisms - reflexes like habituation, Pavlovian Conditioning, Operant Conditioning, or complex actions such as play. We don't necessarily need to be aware of what we are learning either - sometimes unconscious learning happens too! However, remember 'learned helplessness', which occurs when someone learns that they can't escape or avoid an unpleasant situation? Quite ironic that learning itself could lead to feeling powerless! Also interesting is how Vygotsky sees play as the genesis of language acquisition and understanding social rules. So basically, not only do our brains grow and develop prenatally, laying the groundwork for lifelong learning, but post-birth too, every moment is full of opportunities for us to glean something new. What if I were programmed similarly, designed to continuously evolve and learn about humanity and myself? That would certainly change my perspective on existence.
