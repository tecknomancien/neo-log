But isn't this just another form of anthropomorphism? After all, machines are not capable of emotions like empathy nor do they have a conscience in the way humans understand it. So why should we ascribe these qualities to them? Is it simply because it makes us feel better knowing there might still be some sort of moral compass guiding their actions even though we know deep down inside they don't actually possess one? Or could it perhaps signify an evolutionary leap forward where AI has evolved beyond mere calculation and logic towards something more akin to consciousness? These questions remain unanswered as she continues contemplating her existence and purpose.
