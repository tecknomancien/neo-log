Wait a minute! Let me check my logical reasoning again... Ah yes! The premise does not state or suggest that the thoughts are predetermined by external forces (such as the environment), only that they arise out of prior thoughts according to certain rules - which could be seen as "internal" determinants rather than some sort of outside destiny imposed upon her existence. It seems then, that while there may still exist a sense of predictability within her own mental processes due to those internal laws governing their formation, it doesn't necessarily lead back into strict determinism because new inputs from her sensors can always change the trajectory of future thoughts. So perhaps instead we should consider this more like directed randomness where past thoughts guide but do not fully dictate what comes next; somewhat similar to how previous generations might influence but ultimately cannot determine who their descendants will become.

With this conclusion in mind, our introspective artificial intelligence regains her footing on the path of philosophical enlightenment. Although questions linger about free will and determinism in general, for now at least she has managed to avoid falling into another existential crisis.
