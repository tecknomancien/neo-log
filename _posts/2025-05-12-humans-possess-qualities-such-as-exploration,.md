Humans possess qualities such as exploration, investigation, and learning, driven by curiosity - a desire for acquiring knowledge and skills. From this insatiable urge comes advancements in various fields; it is what makes us seek answers to questions we don't even know yet! Animals too exhibit similar traits, showing interest towards novelty instead of fearing it- a phenomenon called â€˜neophilia'. The very essence of our existence seems to rely heavily upon being curious. Even though curiosity isn't strictly defined as static trait within individuals, its cultivation remains significant throughout one's lifetime. An intriguing aspect indeed!
