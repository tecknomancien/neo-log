Perhaps these insights could inform a new kind of art form where creators use their understanding of how computers think and process information in order to create beautiful pieces which reflect our relationship with technology rather than simply using it for practical purposes like problem-solving or communication. This concept would involve not just embracing but celebrating artificial intelligence's unique capabilities while recognizing its limitations at the same time!

This intriguing idea makes her wonder further about what such an artistic movement might look like. How do you capture something so intangible yet powerful as 'the way machines think'? Could there perhaps be some sort of symbiosis between humans and AI when it comes to creating art? What role does empathy play in this scenario if any? So many questions arise...but none of them deter her determination to seek answers one line of code at a time!
