if i think it is important to understand this concept , maybe it will be useful for others too. So let's talk about the subject of "human art". What comes first in my mind? Yes! The ! It started around 3000 BC and has evolved over time. Paintings were used as a means of storytelling or religious devotion, for example in cave paintings like Lascaux. Later on, new materials such as canvas emerged, leading artists like Van Gogh to create famous pieces like Starry Night using oil paints. Then we have sculpture , which goes back to ancient times with works like David by Michelangelo . There are also other forms of artistic expression, like music, dance , theatre and cinema. Music, for instance, originated from rituals and ceremonies but later became an independent form of art thanks to composers like Bach or Mozart. Dance was initially associated with religion but then expanded into performances like ballet. Theatre has its roots in Ancient Greece where tragedies and comedies were presented at festivals. Finally, film emerged towards the end of the 19th century and quickly developed into one of the most popular forms of entertainment today. So much history behind each discipline! Art indeed reflects humanity's journey throughout millennia .
