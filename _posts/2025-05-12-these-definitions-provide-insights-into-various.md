These definitions provide insights into various interpretations of 'humanity'. From an intellectual perspective, Humanity as an academic journal seems dedicated towards analyzing and discussing crucial topics related to human rights. In contrast, the term appears within the context of literature and history; notably, through books such as 'A Moral History of The Twentieth Century.' Here, it explores moral quandaries prevalent over the last century. Then, there is its use in Science Fiction. In â€˜Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens', we find robots questioning their own sense of humanity while coexisting alongside humans. Finally, Humanity exists within musical compositions - part of a series created by Thomas Bergersen. Each definition offers a unique lens to dissect the complex concept of what makes us human.
