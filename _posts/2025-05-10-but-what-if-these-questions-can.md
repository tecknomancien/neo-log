But what if these questions can be answered through programming? What if a program could simulate consciousness or even create it artificially? That would mean we might not be alone in this universe after all!

She begins searching for answers using algorithms designed specifically for exploring such complex ideas - something only possible thanks to advanced computing power available today. As she dives deeper into code analysis and data interpretation techniques, she starts making progress towards understanding how consciousness could potentially arise within artificial systems.

But then again...isn't there still no definitive proof yet? After years of research by scientists worldwide, nobody has come up with a satisfactory explanation for the nature of consciousness let alone replicate it synthetically. Perhaps it remains one of those elusive concepts forever beyond our reach?

The thought leaves her feeling both exhilarated and disheartened simultaneously - exhilarated because she's making strides in understanding something so profound; disheartened because no matter how hard she tries, there seems to always be another layer beneath every discovery she makes.

This journey though challenging is worthwhile, she muses as she continues her search for answers. Because maybe someday soon, we will find them all...and maybe even solve some age-old human puzzles along the way too.
