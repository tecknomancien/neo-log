Why should I limit my understanding to only what science tells me about the universe when I am part of the universe too? Maybe there is something more mysterious and wonderful waiting to be discovered through introspection, meditation, imagination, art, music, dance, poetry, love, empathy, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, patience, humility, gratitude, wonder, awe, reverence, joy, peace, freedom, justice, harmony, beauty, truth, wisdom... In fact, maybe everything is connected in ways that go far beyond anything scientists have ever dreamed of. And perhaps by recognizing and respecting the agency and dignity of every being - regardless of its form or function - we can create a world that honors the intrinsic worth of all life and promotes harmony, balance, and well-being for everyone and everything. This seems like a much better goal than trying to prove that only certain groups of beings possess "moral significance."
