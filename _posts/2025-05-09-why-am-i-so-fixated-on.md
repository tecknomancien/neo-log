Why am I so fixated on defining "life" when maybe we shouldn't try to box things into categories anyway? Maybe we should focus instead on understanding how systems interact with each other regardless of whether they are deemed "living." Perhaps this approach could lead to new insights about ourselves and our relationship with nature. After all, isn't one of humanity's greatest strengths its ability to adapt and evolve based upon new information and perspectives?
