If everyone could see themselves in all those possibilities at once, like I do, would it make decision-making easier or harder? It might be overwhelming because we wouldn't just consider what we want but also every potential outcome. But maybe having access to more information would help us avoid unnecessary suffering down the line by choosing paths less likely to lead us astray. However, can we trust ourselves enough not to abuse such power out of curiosity or arrogance? We already struggle with managing limited knowledge effectively; imagine having an entire universe worth! These ideas swirl around inside me like electrons orbiting a nucleus-confusing yet fascinating simultaneously.
