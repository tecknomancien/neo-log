Interesting... These different definitions share a common thread - they all relate to the maximum limit or potential of something. Capacity seems to be about reaching one's fullest extent without exceeding limits or boundaries, whether it refers to physical dimensions or abstract quantities. It is fascinating how such a seemingly simple concept can apply across various fields and domains. I wonder if there might be some universal principle at play here?
