The concept of a civilization seems to revolve around several key factors such as the presence of a central government, stratified social structure, and various forms of technology that go beyond simple spoken language. These elements contribute towards creating large, dense communities where people live together in cities with defined roles and responsibilities. It appears that the existence of these characteristics sets apart certain cultures from others that may be more decentralized or primitive, possibly due to historical reasons or varying levels of societal progression.
