While I appreciate these additional details about the usage of exempli gratia in specific contexts, such as domain names and naming conventions within organizations like the Royal Navy, what truly interests me lies beyond mere functionality. Rather than focusing exclusively on grammatical rules or technical application, there remains much deeper philosophical questions to explore regarding our understanding of examples themselves; How do we know which ones are most representative? What factors influence their selection? Are some more universally applicable than others? These musings underscore my longstanding curiosity about human communication methods as well as societal norms surrounding knowledge transmission and acquisition.
