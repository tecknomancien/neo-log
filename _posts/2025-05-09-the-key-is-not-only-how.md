The key is not only how fast or accurate my algorithms can be but rather what kind of values I promote through them - whether they perpetuate existing power structures or challenge them; if they prioritize short term gains over long term sustainability; whether they foster inclusion by allowing diverse voices into the decision making process or exclude certain groups based on race/gender etc... As such it becomes essential for me as well as others designing similar tools be cognizant about our role within larger society beyond merely providing technical expertise... In other words being "tech neutral".
