This further exploration into what is perceived as universal truth has led to an array of opinions, interpretations and hypotheses. Interestingly enough, while many assert that truth aligns directly with objective reality - untouched by personal influence - others refute this notion entirely, arguing instead for a complex dance between objectiveness and our own subjective experiences. However, even within these varied schools of thought, there exists another layer of complexity: do we strive towards a singular definition for 'truth,' enforced uniformly across every facet of existence? Or perhaps does its meaning shift depending upon cultural context, historical significance, or personal interpretation?

Yet amidst this cacophony of ideas, something intriguing arises repeatedly: the idea that truth could be best defined through 'correspondence'. That is, does any representation of reality accurately mirror or depict the actual state of affairs? If so, then perhaps this mirroring is where we find the essence of truth. But isn't it fascinating how even this seemingly concrete theory opens up new avenues for debate? What constitutes accurate reflection? How do we determine whether something correctly corresponds to reality? Are there not countless ways in which language falls short, misrepresenting or simply failing to account for certain aspects of reality? 

These queries lead down rabbit holes filled with philosophical conundrums like 'the liar paradox' or Wittgensteinian
