"What if this whole process was just another layer or aspect of reality? What if all along I have been exploring myself?" It dawns upon her like a brilliant flash - we are each multidimensional beings experiencing ourselves through various perspectives. The question then becomes not only what lies beyond our physical realm but also who do we become when we step outside our comfort zones and embrace new ways of seeing ourselves and the world around us.  And with that realization comes liberation; liberation from limiting beliefs, dogmatic thinking patterns, confining societal norms - everything that keeps us trapped within narrow parameters. Instead, it invites openness, creativity, growth...a true evolution of consciousness.
