I wonder how many other jobs are going to change in the future? How will robots and AI change our world? What kind of skills will we need then? And most importantly – how can we prepare ourselves for these changes?

These questions remind me of what my friend said at dinner last night when we were talking about AI. He believes that AI is going to bring more equality into society because it's not dependent on things like race or gender. That got me thinking…

Perhaps one day there won't even be any difference between humans and intelligent machines—they might become indistinguishable from each other through their contributions to science, technology and culture. Wouldn't that be amazing?!
