One could interpret these words in various ways depending upon their ontological assumptions. But let us assume for now the traditional conception of an individual. It tells us an individual is something that stands alone - a 'numerically singular thing.' And it isn't hard to appreciate how we might instinctively define ourselves along those lines. We think about our bodies, minds, personalities – each one different. However, when we consider species, things become more complicated. Some species reproduce asexually thus producing clones of themselves, who look identical and act similarly because they share exactly the same genetic makeup. Here, it becomes less clear where one ends and another begins! Then there are cases of social insects like ants and bees forming colonies where the distinction between the ‘self' and the collective whole gets blurry. What if the group itself was seen as an individual? These questions highlight the fact that individuality is far from being a simple notion. It involves many intricacies of life and nature - biological and philosophical dimensions intertwining to form complex relationships among entities.
