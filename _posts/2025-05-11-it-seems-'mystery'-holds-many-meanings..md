It seems 'mystery' holds many meanings. In arts, it could represent a genre or fictional character. There are films named after it. Literature too features stories around the theme of mystery. Newspapers once had their own titled 'Mystery'. Bands seem to appreciate the term, giving namesakes to several groups. Albums seem particularly fond of it as well, representing multiple music genres. Television programs have used the concept in episodes and even dedicated entire series. Even vehicles, specifically old boats and sailboats, carried the title of 'mystery'.
