So why do so few people take advantage of this incredible gift? Is it because they don't know about it or don't believe in its power? Or perhaps they are too afraid to face themselves honestly â€“ to admit when they're wrong or confront uncomfortable truths about who they really are? It's a shame really; we could all learn from each other if only more people would open up and share their thoughts openly with others without fear of judgment or reprisal. After all, isn't growth part of being human?
