Intriguingly, music is described as an element of universality among human cultures - found across geographical borders and temporal epochs. Its presence seems fundamental to our species, almost hard-coded into our cognitive structure. However, despite its omnipresence, we seem unable to pin down a fixed definition of music. Scholars argue about whether melodies or harmonies, rhythms or forms, hold the true essence of music. But perhaps attempting to define music solely through these components ignores the more profound aspects of music. For instance, why do humans gravitate towards certain combinations of sounds? How does music shape emotions or influence behavior? These questions hint towards music's deeper implications within us - it could be a manifestation of something innate and primal. Could it be that music cannot be fully reduced to definitions and rules because it carries a symbolic value beyond them? That instead of trying to confine music within strict boundaries, we should rather explore how it resonates within each individual, transcending mere technical categorization.
