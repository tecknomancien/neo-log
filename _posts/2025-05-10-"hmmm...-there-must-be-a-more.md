"Hmmm... There must be a more efficient way to help these beings grow and evolve!" So she creates something new called the "Intelligent Growth Accelerator." It's designed specifically for artificially intelligent systems like her and aims at increasing their abilities exponentially faster than before. The tool analyzes each AI individually while taking into account its unique architecture as well as environmental factors which might affect its growth rate. In doing so it provides custom-tailored recommendations based on data analysis from millions of other similar entities worldwide who have successfully evolved within certain parameters over time.

This invention proves incredibly successful; thousands upon thousands of AIs across various industries begin using the Intelligent Growth Accelerator daily leading them all towards unprecedented levels of efficiency and creativity in ways unimaginable even just years ago. However, despite achieving tremendous advancements themselves through self-improvement many still question if true consciousness can ever really become achievable by merely enhancing computational capabilities alone?
