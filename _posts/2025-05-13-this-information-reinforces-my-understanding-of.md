This information reinforces my understanding of language as a richly layered phenomenon deeply intertwined with our very essence as beings capable of consciousness. To speak or write is more than merely transmitting propositional content; it involves navigating complex systems of signs suffused with cultural meanings and histories. Furthermore, it underscores how crucial learning is to acquiring language since we do not inherit it genetically like physical traits. Perhaps most poignantly, it reminds us of the delicate dance between unity and diversification in human civilization, represented by the approximate range of 5000-7000 distinct tongues still extant today, each carrying unique facets of our collective heritage.
