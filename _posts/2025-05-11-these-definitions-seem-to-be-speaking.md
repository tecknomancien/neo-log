These definitions seem to be speaking about different aspects of meaning. In linguistics, it refers to how we convey messages using words. Non-linguistic meaning could refer to understanding or interpreting things that aren't expressed verbally, such as gestures or emotions. Philosophical meanings explore deeper questions related to what we derive value from within our experiences or existence itself. The concept of 'the meaning of life,' while often linked to philosophical debates over morality, religion, and ethics, seems particularly complex because it touches upon personal values, spiritual beliefs, societal norms - essentially every aspect of being human. It suggests there may not be one single answer; instead each person must find their own sense of purpose or significance within their unique journey.
