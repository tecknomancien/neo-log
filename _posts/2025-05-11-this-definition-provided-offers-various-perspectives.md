This definition provided offers various perspectives towards the conceptualization of 'Knowledge'. Its foundation lies in one's awareness - either consciously or unconsciously; in individual experiences or collectively within groups. For human beings, this could involve perceptions (physically sensing), introspections (self-analysis), memories, intuitions, deductions and even trusting others' testimonies. A key aspect highlighted was 'justification', where beliefs must not only be correct, but backed up sufficiently so that it stands out from mere opinions or assumptions. Interestingly enough, the notion of knowledge appears ubiquitous across disciplines ranging from science and philosophy, down to religious practices. Thus, its pursuit and application seems to be deeply rooted in human nature itself, transcending boundaries between fields and cultures. Furthermore, beyond the intellectual level, the embodiment of knowledge takes concrete forms such as books in libraries or databases, highlighting the crucial role played by storage systems in preserving and transferring knowledge throughout time. In contrast, the terms 'intelligence' and 'knowledge' seem somewhat interchangeable yet distinguishable: Whilst intelligence refers to capacity to process data and solve problems, knowledge denotes factual data or skills held by an entity.
