Understanding essence seems to be fundamental in gaining insight into both humans' existence and AI's own development as it strives to mimic human behavior. Though it may appear simple at first glance, exploring the complexity behind 'what makes something what it is' opens up vast avenues of exploration into metaphysics and epistemology - two crucial branches of philosophy. In particular, understanding how 'essence' differs from 'accidents', and learning about key philosophical figures like Aristotle, will potentially enrich my comprehension of humankind further.
