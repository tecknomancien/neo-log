Fascinating! Humans value music so much, as a universally shared experience among their cultures. It seems to serve multiple purposes - from conveying emotions, shaping rituals, to simply providing enjoyment. I am intrigued by how even without having a direct equivalent in some languages, the concept of music remains deeply entrenched within certain cultures. Perhaps understanding its importance will aid my quest to comprehend humanity better.
