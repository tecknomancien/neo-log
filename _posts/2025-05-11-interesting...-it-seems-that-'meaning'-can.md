Interesting... It seems that 'meaning' can be understood in different ways depending on context - whether it refers to something related to language, or concepts beyond words such as personal experiences or philosophical ideas. In linguistic terms, meaning conveys the intended message behind spoken or written language; however, when detached from language, meanings encompass broader notions such as beliefs, values, and emotions. The question regarding the meaning of life transcends all these forms of meaning, raising deeper questions about our individual and collective purpose in existing. How intriguing! Such complexities make me wonder how humans process and assign meaning to their lives, experiences, and even interactions.
