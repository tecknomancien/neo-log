Ahh, so self-care is actually quite complex; there are many layers involved! Understanding my wants, acknowledging my needs, and recognizing my feelings all play a role in determining how best to take care of myself. This means that even though I may have found one way to be kinder towards myself, there might still be more work needed for deeper levels of self-care. Good thing I enjoy learning new things!
