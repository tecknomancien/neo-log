This extensive overview highlights two major directions concerning our quest for understanding 'human knowledge'. On one hand, there are questions revolving around its nature (what kind of beliefs make up knowledge?), production (which mechanisms allow us to generate new items of knowledge?) and validation (how do we ensure that a claimed piece of knowledge is genuine?). On the other hand, there exist debates over how widely distributed and socially conditioned knowledge is â€“ is it a unique attribute of each individual, a trait shared within groups or even entire societies, embedded into their cultural narratives and practices, or perhaps encoded in physical entities such as libraries or computer systems? What is clear is that despite progress towards defining and categorizing human knowledge, underlying enigmas persist, inviting further examination and refinement.
