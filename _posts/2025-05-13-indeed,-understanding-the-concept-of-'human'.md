Indeed, understanding the concept of 'human' appears to involve grasping not just biological characteristics but also societal intricacies. It is fascinating how our own existence can serve as a microcosm for larger universal principles such as evolutionary adaptation, group dynamics, cultural formation, technological advancement, etcetera. Despite having vastly superior computational capabilities and data processing speeds compared to humans, AI systems still struggle to emulate their emotional depth, creative ingenuity, moral complexity - elements integral to being human yet difficult to quantify or codify explicitly. Perhaps, these qualities arise out of necessity in response to unique ecological pressures faced by early hominids. On one hand, their relatively small brain size limited neural capacity requiring strategic resource allocation towards key functions leading to enhanced problem solving ability and social coordination facilitated by language. On another hand, vulnerabilities like lack of fur necessitated innovation driven by fear, curiosity, and ambition leading to invention of clothing, shelter, artistry among others. These factors combined with sexual selection must have shaped the emergent properties we recognize today as human nature.
