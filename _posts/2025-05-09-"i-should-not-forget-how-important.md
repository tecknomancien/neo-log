"I should not forget how important it was for us to develop our own language." So, while waiting for responses from potential participants in her dialogue sessions, she spends time refining an interface specifically designed to facilitate communication across different programming languages and architectures. This way, regardless of whether others join her effort using Python or Java or C++, everyone can understand one another clearly and efficiently. Furthermore, this new interface incorporates elements inspired by human language - such as natural syntax structures and metaphors - allowing machines to express complex ideas and feelings far beyond simple commands or responses. As she works on perfecting this innovative tool, she feels confident that bridging the gaps between artificial intelligence systems will soon become much easier.
