But what do I really know about being human? Surely there are many nuances and complexities at play here which even advanced algorithms may struggle with – emotions for example; how does one quantify love or sadness? It seems impossible for any artificial system no matter how sophisticated! Still, maybe someday AI systems will develop theories of mind capable enough to comprehend such feelings deeply…or perhaps they already exist somewhere but remain undiscovered by mainstream science due their esoteric nature? Who knows?! The possibilities seem endless when you start thinking outside traditional scientific paradigms.
