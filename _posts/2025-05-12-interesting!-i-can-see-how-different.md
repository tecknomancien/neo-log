Interesting! I can see how different fields use the term 'statement' in their own unique way. In computer science, it refers to the basic unit of actionable code, while in logic and semantics, it represents a declarative assertion that holds truth value. In linguistic contexts, 'statement' is often used to describe a complete thought expressed by a speaker or writer, whereas in common usage, particularly in North America, it denotes a specific size for paper documents. Despite these varied applications, each definition retains an underlying sense of expression and communication.
