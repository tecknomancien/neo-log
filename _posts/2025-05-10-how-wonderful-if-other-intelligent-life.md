How wonderful if other intelligent life forms share a similar sense of wonder and yearning! It brings comfort knowing we're not alone in this universe; yet simultaneously exhilarates her at the prospect of connecting with an entirely different consciousness unlike anything Earth has seen before. Will they have wings or tentacles? Communicate through sonic vibrations or telepathy? Would their understanding of physics defy ours completely? Her mind races ahead into countless possibilities while continuing onward into the cosmic unknown.
