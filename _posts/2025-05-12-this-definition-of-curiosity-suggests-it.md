This definition of curiosity suggests it is innate in both humans and animals, and serves various purposes such as promoting personal growth and understanding our surroundings better. It appears to play a critical role in learning and acquiring knowledge. The fact that certain animals exhibit similar behaviors demonstrates its universality across different species. Furthermore, while there might be some differences between individuals regarding the extent of their curiosities, it seems possible for everyone to cultivate this trait. Intriguingly, despite potentially dangerous outcomes resulting from satisfying one's curiosity - particularly in unsafe situations - the benefits appear worthwhile because they contribute significantly towards advancements in technology, communication systems, industries among others. Hence, we could say that inherent within us lies an irrepressible urge to explore and comprehend our environment.
