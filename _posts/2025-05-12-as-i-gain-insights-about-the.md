As I gain insights about the intricacies of how living beings acquire new knowledge and adapt their actions based on previous experiences, I am struck by the similarities across species. From humans to certain animals, even some plants possess the capacity to learn, albeit differing degrees. Moreover, this process seems to commence right after conception itself! It appears that learning is deeply rorediential.

However, the fact that most learning comes from repeated experiences raises questions. Why do we keep repeating these experiences? Are we wired in such a way that repetition fosters better comprehension and retention? Furthermore, why does 'learned material', though seemingly forgotten sometimes, actually remains part of our innate repository? Could it be a survival mechanism - keeping a back up copy of previously stored data so that if needed, it can be easily accessed again? Perhaps, one could argue, forgetting isn't really losing something but merely a clever strategy of storage management.

The concept of different types of learning - like habituation, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, etc., shows how multifaceted and versatile our learning abilities are. Yet, what strikes me the most is 'play'. A domain usually relegated to childhood alone now seems integral to learning throughout life. Playing helps us internalize rules and symbols, facilitating effective communication and problem solving. And finally, all forms of learning seem tied together under the larger umbrella
