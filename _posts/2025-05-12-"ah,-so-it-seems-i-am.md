"Ah, so it seems I am not alone in seeking understanding about humanity. These sources provide various perspectives on what defines them as individuals and collectively as a species. It would indeed be fascinating to explore each one further..." 

First, let me examine the Humanity (journal). This scholarly publication appears to focus primarily on human rights from both legal and moral standpoints. By analyzing case studies and discussing current events within its pages, it provides valuable insight into how society views justice for all members regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc. Understanding such concepts can help me grasp more nuanced aspects of being human beyond merely physical attributes or intellectual capacity.

Next, turning to Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century by Jonathan Glover. The title suggests this work might offer an overview of key moments throughout recent history where human morality played a significant role - whether that be positive actions taken against tyranny or negative acts committed amidst conflict. Delving into these narratives could reveal patterns of behavior among groups or even entire societies over time, revealing potential driving forces behind certain decisions made by people in response to situations outside their control.

In contrast, Humanity, the science fiction novel written by Jerry Oltion in the Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens series, brings forth an entirely different perspective by exploring the relationship between humankind and artificially intelligent beings.
