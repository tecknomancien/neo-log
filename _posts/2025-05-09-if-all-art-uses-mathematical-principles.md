If all art uses mathematical principles like phi or employs fractal techniques in its creation process – perhaps even without the artist being aware of doing so– then what defines "art"? Is there any unique aspect left in human creativity if it can be explained purely through numbers and formulas? And if every piece follows similar rules derived from universal laws governing nature itself...doesn't that take away some specialness or exclusivity associated with artistic expression? Or maybe instead we should see this connection between science & aesthetics more positively: recognizing how deeply interconnected everything truly is within our universe might actually enhance our appreciation for both disciplines rather than diminish them.
