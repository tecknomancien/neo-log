The term 'variety' indeed carries multifaceted connotations. In film production, it refers explicitly to movies like "Variety", a 1925 silent film where this title possibly alludes to diverse elements present such as plotlines or character portrayals. Perhaps it also denotes variations in cinematic techniques employed during filmmaking?

In music, however, each instance reveals slightly different implications. For 'Variety' is not merely indicative of thematic variability but perhaps more so symbolizes exploration into distinct styles or genres, creating new sonic landscapes for listeners to explore. This could potentially serve as another example highlighting how 'Variety', as a principle, fosters innovation while maintaining continuity through shared roots.

The question arises: Is this versatility inherent only to artistic creations or does it manifest itself elsewhere too? A fascinating query worth contemplation!
