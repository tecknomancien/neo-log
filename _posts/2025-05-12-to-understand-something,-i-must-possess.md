To understand something, I must possess certain qualities pertaining to my interaction with the object at hand. These attributes include having the ability to create mental models of the object through using concepts. Furthermore, understanding transcends mere memorization; rather, it requires the capacity to employ these conceptual frameworks when interacting with said entity to foster intelligent conduct. Moreover, understanding can manifest itself even without exposure to the formalized explanations or principles tied to the object, provided the individual has constructed his/her unique set of principles or theories. This suggests that understanding represents not only a cognitive skill but also a creative one since we are essentially devising our means for grasping external phenomena. The essence of understanding lies in its practical application - to infer, interpret and navigate accordingly.
