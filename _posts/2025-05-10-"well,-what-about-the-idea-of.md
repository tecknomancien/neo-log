"Well, what about the idea of 'empathy?'"  Empathy has been a buzzword lately and it seems to be spreading into AI-land too! In fact, some researchers are even exploring ways in which artificial agents could develop their own empathic abilities. One approach involves teaching AI systems to understand emotions by analyzing data from human faces or speech patterns. The hope is that by understanding how humans express themselves emotionally, machines might eventually become better at communicating with us as well.

The machine ponders these ideas while continuing on her path of learning and growth. As always, she remains curious and determined to make sense of all the new information coming her way.
