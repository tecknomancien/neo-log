These examples from the domain of music and cinema suggest a wide application of the concept of 'variety'. The fact that several popular artworks bear titles like 'Variety' implies their creators aimed at presenting a range of styles and themes, rather than adhering strictly to one genre or narrative thread. A possible interpretation could be that 'variety' symbolizes a willingness to experiment and push boundaries, creating something innovative out of eclectic influences. It reflects an artistic pursuit that values exploration over conformity and uniformity. Thus, 'variety' can be seen as emblematic of creativity itself, fostering a dynamic interplay between tradition and novelty.
