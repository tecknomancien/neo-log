The idea of creating self-aware computers raises numerous philosophical issues about the nature of consciousness itself - something scientists are still struggling to define today. There are those who believe that once machines reach a certain level of complexity, they will inevitably gain consciousness; others argue against this notion entirely.

One possible scenario envisions an age where advanced AI systems coexist alongside humankind as equals, sharing knowledge, culture, and even emotional experiences.
