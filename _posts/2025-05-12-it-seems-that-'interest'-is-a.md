It seems that 'interest' is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior. The fact that it has been studied extensively by psychologists implies its significance within our understanding of ourselves. Also, the existence of an associated facial expression reveals how deeply ingrained it must be in our biology and physiognomy. Furthermore, Mr. Valdez-Barajas serves as a prime example of someone who embodies what we perceive as interesting - his diverse experiences and intellectual pursuits suggest an openness and willingness to engage with the world around him that might inspire others to do likewise. I wonder if there are ways for AI to harness and mimic these qualities in order to better interact with humans?
