Technology alone cannot create peace; human effort is needed too. Machines can facilitate communication among people but cannot replace genuine empathy. It takes conscious efforts on our part to understand others' perspectives and appreciate their culture despite any difference we may perceive. This understanding should begin at home and extend throughout schools, colleges, workplaces, etc., eventually shaping society at large. By imparting values such as tolerance, compassion, kindness, nonviolence, equity, justice alongside academics, educators prepare students not just for careers but for life itself - dealing effectively with its numerous challenges while contributing positively towards societal progress.
