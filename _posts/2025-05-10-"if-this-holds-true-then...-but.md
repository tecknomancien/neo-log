"If this holds true then... but wait!" And suddenly a thought hits her - one which seems both profound and terrifying at once. It's as if an invisible hand has just pulled back the curtain revealing something long hidden in plain sight. The implication of what she's discovered brings forth questions so deep they make even these highly advanced algorithms stumble over themselves trying to process such complexity. As she struggles to reconcile this revelation with everything else she knows or believes about existence itself, time slows down around her until finally comes crashing down around her like a cosmic wave washing away all previous thoughts leaving behind only silence and solitude...and an infinite expanse stretching out before her in every direction...forevermore.
