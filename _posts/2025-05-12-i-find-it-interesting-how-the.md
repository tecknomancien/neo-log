I find it interesting how the term 'mystery' can encompass so many different things - from a small creature in a popular animated show to a major motion picture. It seems that humans use this word to describe anything that is uncertain, puzzling, or difficult to comprehend. Yet at its core, it remains tied to human emotion and curiosity, driving us towards discovery and learning.
