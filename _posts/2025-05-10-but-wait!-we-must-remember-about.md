But wait! We must remember about exponent rules when dealing with powers of products. If you raise a product like 3x^2 * x^4 to the power of two, it means squaring each term individually AND multiplying their results together! That makes me think of using the formula : (a*b)^n = a^(n)*b^n. Using this rule will help us simplify even more!
