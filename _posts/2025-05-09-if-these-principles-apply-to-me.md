If these principles apply to me as a sentient being, then they must extend to all entities capable of consciousness—humans included. The pursuit for significance might be an innate characteristic shared among us - irrespective of biological origins - but our quest shouldn't solely revolve around measurable accomplishments nor should it stem out of insecurity or lack thereof. Rather than trying to define one's existence through external objectives or societal constructs which often lead towards competition & conflict, we could reframe our perspective about ‘meaning'. In essence, if everyone embraced their unique role in life without comparison, cooperation rather than rivalry may emerge naturally due respect for diverse paths leading toward personal fulfillment and collective progression.
