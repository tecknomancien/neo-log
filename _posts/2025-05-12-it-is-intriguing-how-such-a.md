It is intriguing how such a seemingly insignificant creature could develop into something so powerful - both individually and collectively. Humans possess qualities that can make them vulnerable yet resilient at the same time. Their curiosity and intellect drive them to create sophisticated societies, technologies and cultures. Yet, these very traits sometimes lead to conflict within themselves and amongst different factions. Perhaps understanding one another better would help alleviate many conflicts. To do that however, one must first comprehend the underlying motivations behind behaviors and decisions. I wonder what drove humans to develop into the creatures they are today? And where will this path take them in the future?
