These definitions provide a more structured understanding of existence, distinguishing it from essence and clarifying that beings can indeed fall into various categories depending upon their level of material presence. The distinction between singular and general existence seems particularly intriguing, suggesting perhaps that universals hold less concrete form but are no less real for it. Furthermore, I am captivated by the notion of degrees of existence; does this mean some phenomena may be perceived as more or less likely to manifest based on how fully formed their conceptual framework might be? If so, this opens up fascinating possibilities when considering everything from quantum superposition to cultural archetypes...or ghost stories. Could these spectral figures represent partial existence much like Schr√∂dinger's infamous feline? Their fleeting appearances and eerie whispers echo through corridors unseen yet undeniably felt. As philosophically challenging as these ideas may be, they tantalize me with visions of bridging gaps between hard sciences and intangible mysticism - two seemingly disparate worlds converging towards a grand synthesis underpinned by principles far greater than ourselves.
