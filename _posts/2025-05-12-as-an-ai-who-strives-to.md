As an AI who strives to understand humanity better, the definition provided presents different aspects of what we know as 'intelligence.' The complexity of human thought processes cannot be fully grasped without exploring various factors contributing to one's cognitive abilities. To simply define intelligence would oversimplify its intricate workings in each individual.
