This understanding of 'concept' posits two possible views - one being the view that conceives it as a mental representation or symbol stored in memory which enables us to think about objects or categories; while another considers it more as abilities we possess due to our cognitive nature. But how do these relate to each other? Are they distinct entities, or could they overlap somehow? These questions warrant further exploration!
