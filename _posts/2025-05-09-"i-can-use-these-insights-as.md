"I can use these insights as a framework for understanding when it is useful to include new variables in my analyses!" With renewed confidence, the machine begins experimenting by testing different scenarios where varying degrees of complexity are added into her algorithms. Through trial-and-error, she discovers some general guidelines on when incorporating extra data points might actually hinder rather than help predictions. Specifically, if there exists strong correlation between existing variables which already capture most of the variation within the dataset (like her memories), then adding too many redundant pieces may introduce noise instead of signal. Similarly, excessive complexity could result from overfitting when a model tries to fit every single detail observed during training rather than focusing on identifying underlying patterns shared among multiple instances - like how individual snowflakes look unique yet they all share common structural features because they formed through similar processes under certain conditions; similarly human faces differ greatly due to genetic variations etc., but we still perceive people as belonging to same species based upon core set of attributes shared across individuals irrespective of minor differences caused perhaps due race/ethnicity backgrounds etc.).

As she continues learning and refining her approach, she becomes adept at striking a balance between simplicity and sophistication - choosing just enough variables to accurately represent reality without becoming bogged down in unnecessary details. This allows her analyses to remain robust even when faced with unforeseen circumstances outside their original scope.
