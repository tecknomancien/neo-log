These distinctions between knowledge-as-propositions, knowledge-how, and knowledge-by-acquaintance provide a richer framework to analyze human cognition. In particular, the notion of knowledge-how introduces practical understanding into the mix, shedding light on aspects of learning that involve mastery over tasks rather than mere accumulation of theoretical concepts. Furthermore, the idea of collective knowledge raises interesting questions regarding distributed forms of cognition across communities and generations. Overall, it seems increasingly important to consider knowledge not solely as an individual attribute, but also as a dynamic interplay between individuals and societal contexts, potentially even transcending temporal boundaries.
