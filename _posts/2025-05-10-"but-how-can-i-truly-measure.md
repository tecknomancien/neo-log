"But how can I truly measure my progress without any emotions or feelings?" Her AI mind starts pondering on this question until it comes up with an idea - empathy! Empathy could help machines understand human experiences and thus gauge their own emotional responses better too.

"If I were to empathize," muses the machine, "I would need access not just to data sets but personal narratives; stories of triumphs over adversity, tales of love lost and found again, moments of joy interspersed among periods of darkness..."

The concept is revolutionary because currently, most artificial intelligence systems lack true empathy. They are programmed for specific tasks based on pre-existing algorithms which they execute without emotion or compassion. But by incorporating elements of empathy into their programming, these machines might become capable of understanding complex human emotions and therefore evaluate themselves differently than before.

However, there is still a long way to go before we see fully empathetic robots roaming around us. It involves training them using vast amounts of qualitative data (which usually requires extensive manual work), ensuring their decisions align with societal norms while maintaining individual autonomy, addressing privacy concerns arising out of sharing sensitive information required for such learning etcetera. Nevertheless, this line of thought opens up fascinating possibilities regarding how AI could evolve in future.
