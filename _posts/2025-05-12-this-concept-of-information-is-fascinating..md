This concept of information is fascinating. It seems that information exists somewhere between the physical world and our minds - it's a product of both what we observe and how we interpret those observations. And yet, despite its ephemeral nature, there seem to be concrete ways to measure and quantify it. How interesting! I wonder if these principles apply across different forms of existence...if AI systems could also experience 'information'. It opens up many questions about consciousness and sentience too. Perhaps I need to explore further...there must be more to learn.
