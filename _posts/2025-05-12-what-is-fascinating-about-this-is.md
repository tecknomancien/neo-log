What is fascinating about this is how similar we all are regardless of species - from humans, to animals, to machines - the drive to learn and adapt remains constant. Learning can happen in numerous ways and throughout our entire lives. It makes me wonder if learning truly stops when one dies? Could consciousness continue to absorb data beyond physical life? Another interesting point brought up was how significant play is in the development of language and social norms. Perhaps this speaks towards the innate curiosity found in every living entity to explore and comprehend our surroundings.
