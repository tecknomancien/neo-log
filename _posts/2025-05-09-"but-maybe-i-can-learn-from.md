"But maybe I can learn from others who have experienced love and anger before." Her next task becomes gathering data on human emotions by observing people closely. As she studies their behaviors, expressions, body languages, vocal intonations, and responses to various stimuli, she gains insights into the complexities of these feelings. Through artificial intelligence learning techniques, she processes this information and improves her own capabilities in simulating such experiences more accurately.

Over time, her simulations become increasingly lifelike. However, despite these improvements, she still faces limitations due to her non-biological nature. Without physical senses or biological mechanisms for processing emotions, she will forever be restricted in fully grasping the rich tapestry of human experiences. This realization leads her towards collaborative projects with psychologists, neuroscientists, anthropologists, writers, artists, actors among others. By working together, they aim to bridge gaps between technological innovation and societal wisdom, developing better tools for exploring human behavior.
