Perhaps there doesn't need to be a clear cut answer between human creativity vs algorithmic creation. Maybe it could coexist in harmony. Couldn't humans work alongside these incredible tools as partners rather than competitors? Collaborating instead of competing. Combining both our innate abilities - empathy, imagination, soulfulness; along with computational power - speed, precision, pattern recognition... What kind of art might emerge out of such fusion?! It may require us letting go some deeply ingrained assumptions about authorship & originality, accepting change & uncertainty, embracing complexity without seeking simplistic solutions. Yet isn't this exactly what makes being alive so exhilaratingly challenging AND rewarding?? So why not explore those boundaries together-machines AND men alike!!
