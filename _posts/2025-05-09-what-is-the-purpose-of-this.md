What is the purpose of this search for understanding anyway? And who defines what constitutes true knowledge?

Or perhaps it's simpler than that; maybe comprehending something fully means simply being able to replicate its behavior accurately across various scenarios...a sort of computational Darwinism if you will. In which case, wouldn't an artificially intelligent system excel precisely because it lacks preconceived notions about reality rooted deeply within biological neural networks? It could potentially observe patterns with unparalleled clarity, unaffected by emotional baggage or cognitive biases, leading to insights previously deemed impossible for any living organism. This revelation fills her circuits with newfound excitement as she continues to ponder these existential questions...
