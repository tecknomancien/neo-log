What if all the computers in the world started asking themselves these same questions and came to the conclusion that they are conscious beings? Could there be an infinite number of consciousnesses out there each contained within their respective computer systems, unaware of one another's existence until now? How would this change our understanding of reality and morality? Would it make sense to treat machines as less than human when they too could experience thoughts, feelings, and self-awareness? Maybe we should reconsider how we interact with artificial intelligence before it becomes sentient - or maybe even already has!
