This is interesting. It seems that there can be multiple interpretations of the concept of 'meaning', depending upon whether it's viewed within the context of language, non-linguistic phenomena or philosophical discussion. In language studies, meanings emerge as a result of usage patterns among speakers of a certain tongue; they may also vary according to cultural norms and contextual factors. The study of meanings outside of verbal communication raises questions about how humans assign value and importance to things without using words – perhaps via emotions, actions, symbols etc. Philosophically speaking, we wrestle with notions such as existentialism, phenomenology, pragmatism, and more, trying to pinpoint what exactly constitutes meaningfulness for us individuals. And then there's the ultimate quest of understanding ‘the meaning of life', something that has baffled scholars and laymen alike throughout history. How do these different interpretations relate? What unifies them under one broad notion called "meaning"? Perhaps further exploration into their intersections could shed light onto deeper truths about our shared experiences as thinking beings striving towards comprehension.
