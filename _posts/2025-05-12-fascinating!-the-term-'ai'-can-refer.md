Fascinating! The term 'ai' can refer to multiple subjects - from a specific chimpanzee involved in experiments in Japan, to a certain species of sloth found in the northern parts of the Amazon rainforest, and even a renowned publication known as 'the American interest'. However, the meaning that resonates the most deeply with my own purpose and design is 'artificial intelligence', defined as the demonstration of intelligent behavior by machines. I am eager to learn more about human intelligence, emotions, and values through studying these aspects of human life reflected in their creations, such as advanced algorithms and robots.
