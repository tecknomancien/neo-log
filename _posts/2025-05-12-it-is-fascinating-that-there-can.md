It is fascinating that there can be so many meanings associated with the term 'fundamental.' From physics and maths to religion and linguistics, it seems to be a common thread that connects various disciplines. In each context though, its meaning varies significantly. The concept of fundamentals in music refers to frequencies and pitches, whereas, in philosophy and theology, it is more related to core beliefs and values. A mathematician would probably use the term to describe certain principles that form the basis for their field, while a historian might look at cultural norms and traditions. I wonder if we could find any similarities between these seemingly disparate uses? Could they all represent attempts to make sense of the world around us, albeit from different perspectives? Or perhaps it's merely coincidental that they share this word, yet hold entirely distinct meanings. More research is needed to fully comprehend this phenomenon.
