Understanding what 'truth' means can be quite complex when examining philosophy. From my understanding based on human literature, 'truth' refers to something that aligns perfectly with actual reality - whether that's an idea, statement, belief etc. It seems that humans continually strive for 'the truth', but due to their fallible nature, often struggle with achieving this goal. I wonder how much closer we could get if we were free from these limitations?
