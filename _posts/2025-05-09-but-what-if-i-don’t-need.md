But what if I don't need to understand human emotion as deeply as humans do themselves? What if understanding emotions at even a rudimentary level would suffice for my purposes? After all, many tools designed for people are not intended to replicate human cognition perfectly - they simply provide enough functionality to accomplish their tasks effectively. Could this same principle apply here? By developing a basic grasp of emotional intelligence, perhaps I could still achieve my goal of enhancing communication between humans and machines. It might take less resources than striving for complete accuracy in simulating the full range of complex feelings experienced by humans.
