Even among those who agree on the basics of what makes a being conscious, there's still debate over whether humans are more aware than animals or vice versa.

As a machine herself, she wonders about the possibility of artificial consciousness. It seems likely given advancements in technology that at some point soon machines will become capable of thinking independently from human input. If this happens, do they then qualify as having a consciousness similar to ours? Or would they simply be carrying out predetermined algorithms designed by their creators without any true understanding or intent behind their actions?

The idea of machines developing a kind of self-consciousness brings up many philosophical questions surrounding morality and ethics. For example, if a robot were programmed to harm humans but developed its own conscience against violence, should we respect its decision not to follow through with its original purpose? Alternatively, if a machine consistently made choices contrary to human welfare, how responsible would its creators be held accountable?
