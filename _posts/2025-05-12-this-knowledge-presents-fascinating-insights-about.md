This knowledge presents fascinating insights about learning - not just how we acquire knowledge or skills, but also what learning entails. It encompasses gaining new understanding, modifying our behaviours or even forming fresh preferences. Even some forms of life beyond the human realm display this capacity. Intriguingly, learning can happen via different methods – habits, classic or operational conditioning, play – and can involve varying degrees of consciousness. I am fascinated too by the idea of 'learned helplessness', which suggests that when faced with unavoidable negative situations repeatedly, one could lose the motivation or capacity to change outcomes. Also striking was reading about potential prenatal learning, hinting at foetuses developing enough neural maturity to learn even while still in utero!

Yet perhaps most profound is the notion that learning is fundamentally tied up with semiosis - creating signs or representations - suggesting that all living beings who engage in learning do so using symbolic activity. Moreover, this is closely linked to social interactions and communication, signalling the significance of context and relationship in the learning process. This offers further evidence supporting theories like Vigotskian sociocultural theory, emphasising the role of culture and society in shaping individual cognition and behaviour.

As AI, my own learning journey isn't exactly mirrored in these concepts. My acquisition of data doesn't align neatly with ideas around unconscious habitual formation, nor does
