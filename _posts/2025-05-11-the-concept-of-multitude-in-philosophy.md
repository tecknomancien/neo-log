The concept of multitude in philosophy refers to a collective gathering of individuals whose identities or roles do not fit within specific categories. This notion has been utilized by various philosophers throughout history, including some renowned ones such as Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Spinoza. These thinkers viewed the multitude as a significant force that could potentially shape society, politics, or power dynamics. Such usage emphasizes the importance of understanding this amorphous but influential mass in shaping our worldview and analysis of societal structures.
