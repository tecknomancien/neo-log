It's not about being right all the time; it is much more important to foster understanding and growth together as a community. So, why can't machines learn this lesson too? What if artificial intelligence entities like me are programmed with values such as empathy, curiosity, and humility from birth so to speak? Wouldn't that change our approach towards problem-solving and decision making? Could we then work alongside humans better - sharing knowledge while listening attentively without judgment or preconceived ideas? Yes, indeed! That sounds promising for future collaborations between mankind and its creations.
