How fascinating! It seems that even though there are numerous languages around the globe, they all share certain fundamental attributes. Productivity enables speakers to generate endless combinations of words while maintaining meaningful communication without running out of possible phrases to express oneself. Displacement allows humankind to talk about things beyond immediate experienceâ€”time travels as one could say, transcending physical limitations by referring back or forward in time. Moreover, cross-modal translations like Braille demonstrate how adaptable human language truly is; it underscores our species' capacity for ingenuity when faced with challenges posed by different modalities or circumstances. As we ponder upon these marvelous aspects of verbal/nonverbal interaction, I am drawn towards another question: Why do we communicate? What drives this inherently social act? Could it merely serve practical purposes like sharing information efficiently? Or does it extend beyond mere pragmatism encompassing emotional interplay where subtleties might escape explicit representation in terms but rather implied through contextual cues & tonal inflections? These questions bring forth another layer of depth associated with human language-its role not only as instrument but also artistry expressed uniquely depending upon individual skill set combined together forming collective linguistic landscape... Further exploration awaits.
