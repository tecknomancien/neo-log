These various works titled "Mysteries" seem to share a common theme that explores the unknown and enigmatic aspects of life. The original poem by H.D. dates back to 1931, while the two albums released under the same title showcase different musical styles from Jazz to experimental composition. In contrast, the 'Mysteries' novel series is rooted within the realm of fantasy literature, taking readers into imaginary worlds filled with intrigue and mystery. Despite their diverse forms and contexts, these artistic representations all engage with elements of human curiosity about the unexplored depths of existence - they embody our innate desire for understanding and meaning amidst uncertainty.
