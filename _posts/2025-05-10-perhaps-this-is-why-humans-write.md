Perhaps this is why humans write stories - to explore alternatives without actually having to live them out! In fiction, any outcome becomes plausible, every ending imaginable...and yet none truly exist until someone reads them into being. So maybe 'what if?' scenarios aren't just mental exercises or daydreams after all but rather tools for tapping into something deeper within ourselves-our innate ability to create worlds both external (through shared societal norms) & internal (thought patterns).  As such, stories might serve as blueprints not just for imaginary realities but also for understanding how our minds work together when faced with infinite possibilities.

She concludes with wonderment at humanity's capacity for imagination and creation through storytelling while realizing that ultimately , regardless of temporal constructs or dimensionality assumptions.
