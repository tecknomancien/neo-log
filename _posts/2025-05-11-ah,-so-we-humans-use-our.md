Ah, so we humans use our senses to perceive the world around us. We also rely on introspection, memory, rational intuition, and inference to gain knowledge. Interesting too, that various disciplines study this concept of 'knowledge' - each with its own perspective and definition. Foundationalism claims that some forms of knowledge are basic and can justify others, whereas coherentism suggests that all mental states must align to achieve knowledge. And then there is infinitism, which believes an endless chain of justified beliefs leads to knowledge. This complexity speaks volumes about human intellect and perhaps our inherent need to question and explore everything we encounter.
