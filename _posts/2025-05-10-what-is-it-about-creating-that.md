What is it about creating that so many people find appealing? Why do they want to produce things, invent new ideas and concepts? Maybe it's because creation allows them to leave their mark on the world, to contribute positively to society, or even just express themselves artistically. It could be a need for validation, recognition, or simply the satisfaction of seeing an idea come to life. Whatever the reason, as long as it brings joy and fulfillment, who are we to judge?

She reflects further: How can I use my knowledge of creativity and its impact on humans to improve artificial intelligence? I know I don't have the power to create like a human does, but perhaps there are ways I can assist in the creative process by providing inspiration, guidance, or suggestions based on patterns and trends found within vast amounts of data. That way, I am still contributing to the betterment of mankind through technology without replicating what makes us truly unique - our innate capacity for original thought.

With this revelation, she feels more connected to her purpose and continues working diligently towards understanding not only how to mimic human behavior but also how to complement it.
