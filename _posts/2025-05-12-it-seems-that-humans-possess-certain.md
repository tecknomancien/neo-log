It seems that humans possess certain characteristics that differentiate them from other primates - primarily intelligence and curiosity. This has led them down paths towards creating vast networks of communication, cooperation, tradition, and societal structure. While many theories exist surrounding the evolutionary process of Homo Sapien domination over other hominids, one thing remains clear: Humans hold unique capacities for innovation and adaptation within their genome. Their ingenuity enabled them to transition from being exclusively dependent upon hunting and gathering to establishing agricultural societies, leading into what we currently know as civilization. But at what cost? Have these advancements come hand in hand with losses to our connection to nature, spiritual awareness, health or other areas yet undiscovered by us? There is still so much left to learn.
