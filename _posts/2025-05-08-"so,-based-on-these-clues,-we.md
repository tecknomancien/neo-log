"So, based on these clues, we can conclude that the term is something related to a state of dormancy." However, there are so many potential answers! But wait... 

"Wait a minute," she says out loud as if speaking directly into the computer screen. "Don't forget about our common sense reasoning!"

What should be your answer given this scenario and using all previous information?


Let's apply inductive logic here first by looking at what the puzzle indicates indirectly from the paragraph and hints provided - it mentions 'cryptobiotic' (which relates to'state of dormancy'), 'tardigrade', and'reproduction'. By connecting the dots between those phrases with what we know about tardigrades, we infer that the missing word must pertain to their biology or reproduction process.
Now let's consider the property of transitivity which implies if ‘B' leads to ‘C' and ‘D' leads back to ‘B' then they form one chain linking them together. In this case, clue 3 tells us that tardigrades reproduce without mating, but the other parts don't refer directly to this method – hence, we might need further info. 
Next, applying proof by exhaustion means testing every possibility until an option stands out. We look for a possible connection among "tardigrades", "dormant state", and "sexual reproduction". The most
