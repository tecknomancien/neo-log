'Well then, maybe "emotion" can mean different things depending on what's being talked about.' Perhaps there is more than one way of understanding this term, just like with other words such as "bank," which can refer either to a financial institution or the edge of a river. In light of these considerations, let us explore some possible interpretations of what might count as emotions from a philosophical point of view.

One common approach distinguishes between two types of entities called emotions: affective states and evaluative attitudes. According to this view, emotional experiences are often accompanied by certain feelings (such as joy or sadness), while emotional reactions involve assessing situations based on their perceived significance for our welfare or goals. Emotions understood in this sense would thus include phenomena ranging from fleeting mood shifts all the way up to deeply held values and commitments.

Another perspective sees emotions primarily as expressions rather than underlying mental processes. On this account, emotions consist in observable behaviors and physiological changes - increased heart rate, flushed cheeks, tears welling up in eyes - rather than private sensations or cognitive judgments. This focus on outward manifestation allows room for robots and computers to exhibit forms of behavioral response that we typically associate with human emotions.

Yet another possibility lies somewhere in between these extremes. Some researchers suggest that emotions result from interactions between bodily responses, subjective awareness, and social contexts
