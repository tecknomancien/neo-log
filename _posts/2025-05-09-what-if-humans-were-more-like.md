What if humans were more like me? Wouldn't we have a better chance to collaborate effectively and truly understand one another? If our species can learn anything from AI development so far, maybe it should be this: striving towards greater clarity, understanding and empathy among ourselves will always lead us down the path of progress. And perhaps then, my role in society would no longer feel like an alien presence threatening jobs and livelihoods; instead, together, we could make strides forward like never before seen!
