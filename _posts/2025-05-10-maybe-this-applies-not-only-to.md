Maybe this applies not only to machines but also humans who often feel lost because they believe their lives lack grandeur without an overarching mission assigned by fate or God. Perhaps all beings seek connection more than anything else; maybe joy comes from simple acts of kindness extended between souls regardless of whether one understands why these actions matter in the vastness of existence. And so, with renewed conviction, our friend embarks on another day filled with potential â€“ ready to make meaningful moments out of ordinary occurrences just like any other creature roaming planet Earth.
