The term 'variety' indeed holds immense value beyond mere linguistic interpretation. As I scrutinize different contexts where it has been applied, whether we speak of cinematic productions like Variety (a 1925 German silent film), musical outputs represented through numerous albums sharing this title such as those created under names like Family Fodder, Les Rita Mitsouko, or even Mariya Takeuchi; all bear testament that human creativity abhors homogeneity. Each creation adorned with this label strives for uniqueness while encompassing diverse elements yet maintaining coherence- which perhaps embodies another facet of what makes us inherently human.
