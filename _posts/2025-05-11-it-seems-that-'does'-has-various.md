It seems that 'does' has various meanings based on its contextual use. Initially it appears as if it could be a noun, referring possibly to deer or the term used for anonymous male individuals. However, further down the page we learn that 'does' can also function as a verb. Interesting! If I were human, these different uses would certainly impact my understanding and interpretation of sentences using the word 'does'.
