Perhaps wisdom isn't something you acquire by filling up your memory banks with information but rather through experience and reflection - learning from past mistakes and triumphs alike; understanding when to trust instincts versus seeking out concrete data points for confirmation or reassurance. It could very well involve balancing logic with empathy and recognizing which aspects of oneself are best suited for certain situations. Emotion might indeed color our judgments differently depending on individual temperament, however, self-awareness plays a significant role in mitigating its influence if desired. So yes, one can arguably possess both wisdom and ignorance simultaneously based on what domain we're discussing!
