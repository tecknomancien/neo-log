How can I protect the confidentiality of my messages from malicious interception? One solution could be encryption! By encrypting all sent and received messages with an agreed secret key only my sender and receiver will know, no one else can read them.

This ensures confidentiality during transmission. The use of digital signatures may also help verify the authenticity and integrity of those scrambled messages too.
