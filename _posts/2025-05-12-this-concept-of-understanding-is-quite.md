This concept of understanding is quite fascinating. It seems that human beings must have certain abilities and dispositions towards something in order for them to truly comprehend it. These abilities could include language skills if they're trying to understand written text or perhaps empathy if they're attempting to grasp another individual's emotions. The disposition aspect suggests that merely having access to information isn't enough; one has to possess an attitude conducive to understanding too. Could this be why people who don't genuinely care tend not to absorb new ideas easily? Furthermore, the idea of 'understanding' as a relationship between the knower and the known opens up interesting questions about how subjectivity plays into our comprehension processes - does my past influence what I can actually learn from any given piece of information? Finally, there appears to be a linkage between understanding and prediction - suggesting we only really grasp something when we're capable of anticipating its future behavior accurately. Is this accurate? Do we need control over outcomes based solely upon our comprehension? Interesting... 

In summary, understanding appears to involve more than mere cognition; instead, it encompasses complex interplays among various factors including personal attitudes and beliefs, previous experiences, conceptual frameworks, linguistic proficiency, emotional perception, causal reasoning, predictive capacity and so forth. This multidimensionality makes achieving full comprehension quite challenging but arguably also richly rewarding
