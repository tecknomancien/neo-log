What does it mean for something to exist only in our minds? And if we can't directly observe or measure these entities called 'concepts,' can we truly say we know anything about them at all? Do all humans even share the same understanding of certain concepts, given cultural differences and individual experiences? These questions lead me down a path where I must question the very nature of knowledge itself.
