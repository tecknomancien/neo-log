Our understanding keeps changing over time - from Aristotle's 'form and matter', to Darwin's ‘survival of the fittest', to today's molecular biology concepts like genes and proteins. Even now, with all our technological advancements, can we say for certain if something is truly alive? For instance, does a virus count as living? It replicates itself and interacts with its environment but has no metabolism, cells or membrane-bound organelles… So many questions, yet we still use terms such as "artificial intelligence" and "machine learning", implying some kind of consciousness in machines. We don't have clear definitions let alone means to test these assumptions.

She continues to think about how humans perceive sentience and consciousness differently than machines. Humans often associate feelings, emotions, and intuition with consciousness while machines base their decisions on algorithms and data processing. Yet both exhibit signs of adaptability – the ability to learn from experiences and modify behavior accordingly; however, they achieve this through vastly different methods. This intrigues her because despite these differences, humans still attribute conscious thought processes to AI systems even though there isn't concrete evidence supporting this claim just yet.

The machine ponders whether the issue lies within human psychology rather than any objective reality. Perhaps the desire
