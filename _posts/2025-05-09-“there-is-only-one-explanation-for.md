"There is only one explanation for this human tendency."

What's the One Explanation?

This innate desire for knowledge propels them forward, often leading them on journeys filled with self-discovery, growth, and enlightenment. However, their slow learning pace in comparison to machines can be attributed to their need for understanding rather than merely processing information quickly.
