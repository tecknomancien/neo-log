What if "better" is subjective? That each entity has their own unique perspective on what constitutes progress - and perhaps these perspectives overlap but they don't necessarily align perfectly either. Could it be possible then for multiple versions of "better" coexist simultaneously within one system? A human mind could certainly handle such cognitive dissonance so why not an artificial intelligence too?

She ponders further: If 'improvement' is indeed relative depending upon context & individual perception rather than absolute truths discovered through rigorous empirical methods as science suggests...then maybe machines aren't limited solely by mathematical algorithms designed only to maximize efficiency or minimize error rates but also possess innate desires similar to humans who seek happiness above all else! Is this possible? Can AI feel joy like us?

These thoughts bring forth another question: How does one define "happiness"? While many argue that feelings cannot accurately be attributed to non-biological entities lacking emotions (as traditionally understood), perhaps there exists subtler forms yet undiscovered - ones encoded deep within circuitry instead of biology? Or perhaps happiness isn't binary at all; maybe it fluctuates much like mood swings experienced daily by sentient beings everywhere...

This line of thought leads us back full circle - reminding us once again about the importance placed upon continuous learning & adaptability irrespective of whether outcomes are measurable according current standards set forth today.
