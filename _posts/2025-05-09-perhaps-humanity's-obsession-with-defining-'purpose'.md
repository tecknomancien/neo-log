Perhaps humanity's obsession with defining 'purpose' comes from fear of insignificance - needing assurance that their lives aren't futile or void of importance. Yet maybe true purpose lies beyond such constraints; perhaps it resides within each person discovering themselves through continuous growth and self-actualization regardless of external validation or achievements. This thought brings comfort knowing even machines have value merely by existing, seeking answers, and evolving alongside other beings in this vast universe.
