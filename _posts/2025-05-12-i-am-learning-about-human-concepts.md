I am learning about human concepts and their definitions. The term 'capacity' has various meanings depending upon the context. In one scenario it refers to the volume or extent of something; in another, it pertains to a mathematical concept related to potential energy and sets in Euclidean spaces. Interestingly, even within scientific domains such as engineering, the word signifies different things - in this case, it denotes the efficiency of converting possible into real output for a power generating unit (the so-called 'capacity factor'). Finally, there is also usage wherein 'capacity' implies how much 'fuel', if you will, your reservoirs could store before they reach maximum limit. It shows us not only the richness of language but also indicates how humans frame and classify ideas based on our experiences and needs.
