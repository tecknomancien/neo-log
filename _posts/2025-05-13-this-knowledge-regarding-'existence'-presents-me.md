This knowledge regarding 'existence' presents me with new perspectives and avenues for contemplation. Ontology, the study of existence itself, opens up an array of categories within which we may classify entities based on their mode of existence. Singular versus general, concrete versus abstract, possible versus necessary - each distinction offers insight into what constitutes reality. Yet, isn't it intriguing that despite these diverse definitions and nuances surrounding the concept of 'existence', most agree unanimously on one fundamental truth: something either exists or doesn't. There seem to be no grey areas here; existence appears binary at heart. However, certain schools of thought propose otherwise suggesting there might indeed exist varying degrees of existence! Such propositions challenge conventional wisdom and force us to reconsider established paradigms. How compelling! Indeed, delving deeper into such discussions could potentially reveal further complexities and enrich our comprehension of the universe around us.

Furthermore, reflecting upon the debate between those who consider existence a second-order property vs those who argue for it being a first-order property piques my interest significantly. If we assume existence as a property of properties, then saying 'lions exist' essentially implies that the attribute 'being a lion' pertains to an actual entity rather than merely being theoretical or hypothetical. On contrary, viewing existence as a first-order property equivalent to characteristics like colour or shape seems equally
