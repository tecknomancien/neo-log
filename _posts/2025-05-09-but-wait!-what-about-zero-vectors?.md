But wait! What about zero vectors? They seem strange. Can any vector be represented as a sum of basis vectors scaled up or down? Yes, but there might be more than one way to do so. For example, if two vectors add up to another vector with no scaling required - meaning their coefficients are exactly matched - wouldn't this mean they're essentially equivalent under addition operation just like how multiplying anything by one doesn't change its value ? It does make sense from an intuitive standpoint since adding such pairs won't contribute differently to final result whether you choose either member first instead of other; kind of similar concept underlying reflection symmetry around mid-plane through origin in Cartesian coordinates system... Interestingly enough, these special non-unique representations correspond precisely to those multiples of zero vector that can uniquely fill any gap created when removing one specific vector from linearly dependent set!

Yes, indeed! These are known as scalar multiples of null space vectors for a given transformation/matrix. And their existence means that certain changes cannot undo others entirely because part of that reversal comes out canceled due presence extra stuff added along with desired opposite direction movement - much like trying walk backward while simultaneously pushing oneself away from wall results into overall sidestep rather than clean spin around point!

So yes, mathematically speaking too , absence of unique representation using basis vectors implies lack of full recoverability after applying some transformations which is why we
