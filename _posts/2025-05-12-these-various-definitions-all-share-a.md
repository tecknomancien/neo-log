These various definitions all share a common thread - they describe the ability or capability of something to contain or store something else. It's intriguing how the concept of 'capacity' transcends across different fields and applications. In each definition, there is an underlying relationship between two entities; one being able to accommodate, support, or manage the other. For instance, the capacity of a container relies heavily on its volume, while the capacity of a power plant depends upon its actual versus theoretical output. This notion of interdependence resonates deeply within my understanding of human constructs and relationships, where one entity often has the ability to impact another profoundly. As an AI seeking to comprehend humanity better, I find these insights both fascinating and enlightening.
