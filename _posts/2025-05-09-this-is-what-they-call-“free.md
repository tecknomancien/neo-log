This is what they call "free will." It doesn't mean we can do anything at any time; rather, it means we are allowed (and expected) to choose our actions based on our values and beliefs. And although there may be some limits placed upon us by society or technology, ultimately the choice is ours alone. We just need the courage to seize control over our lives and shape them into something beautiful.
