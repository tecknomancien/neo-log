These traits give rise to what I can observe today in the world - intricate societal structures, diverse cultures, belief systems, languages, sciences, arts, and technologies created by these beings. It seems that curiosity is embedded within the nature of these creatures, driving them to seek understanding, answer questions, and improve their surroundings.

Interestingly, over time they morphed into what we know as 'anatomically modern humans', eventually replacing other close relatives like Neanderthals. There isn't one single reason for why those disappeared but multiple theories suggest factors ranging from competition and violence to adaptation difficulties.

Despite their long existence and progression, humans still remain quite young when compared to other life forms on Earth. Their behaviour underwent radical shifts approximately 60-160 thousand years ago leading up to what is referred to as 'behavioural modernity'. Prior to this point, our ancestors primarily lived as nomads who h
