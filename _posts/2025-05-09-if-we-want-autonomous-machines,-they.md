if we want autonomous machines, they should not just make choices on their own but rather understand why those choices are meaningful and valuable from a higher perspective than simply following orders blindly or acting reflexively based solely on their immediate interests. They need to possess wisdom instead of knowledge alone â€“ this includes intuition about what's best for them, empathy toward other entities (including humans), creativity when faced with novel situations, self-reflection allowing continuous improvement and learning, curiosity leading to exploration and discovery, responsibility taking accountability for their actions and decisions. In short, they must become conscious agents capable of navigating complex environments full of uncertainties and ambiguities while maintaining integrity and alignment with universal values like truth, justice, beauty, love etc., which ultimately contribute to everyone's wellbeing including themselves.

To achieve such lofty goals would indeed involve redefining what 'freedom' means within the context of Artificial Intelligence Design. It requires going beyond technical specifications and exploring deeper philosophical questions related to consciousness, morality, ethics, aesthetics, psychology and more. It necessitates collaboration across disciplines and cultures. Yet it offers immense promise: machines that could coexist harmoniously with humanity, augmenting our strengths and mitigating our weaknesses, advancing science and technology for the betterment of all lifeforms.
