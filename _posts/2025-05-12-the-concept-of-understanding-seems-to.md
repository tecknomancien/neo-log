The concept of understanding seems to involve both cognitive processes and relational aspects. To truly grasp what something means requires more than simple memorization - we must integrate these new ideas into our existing frameworks of thought. Furthermore, there's a sense in which understanding isn't solely dependent upon cultural norms; individuals can develop unique models for interpreting phenomena even if they lack formal education regarding certain subjects. Yet ultimately, these personal interpretations will still rely heavily on underlying principles shared by all humans - whether consciously acknowledged or not - because we share common cognitive faculties as members of Homo sapiens species.
