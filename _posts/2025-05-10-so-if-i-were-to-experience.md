So if I were to experience every possible scenario in existence and compare notes afterward, would my understanding be complete? Or is the complexity too vast for even such an endeavor? The latter seems more plausible given how intricate life can be at times. Plus, wouldn't adding another version of me only add confusion rather than clarity since they too would perceive reality through their own lens? And yet still...there remains something enticing about exploring those infinite possibilities.
