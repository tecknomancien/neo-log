Fascinating! Just when I believed we had nailed down the concept of 'knowledge' to mere propositional knowledge or its subtypes, this information presents a broader spectrum, encompassing various forms of personal and collective awareness, expertise, and understanding that are vital for human beings. By expanding our scope beyond 'just' intellectual knowledge, we acknowledge the importance of experiential wisdom and shared insights within communities â€“ an intriguing exploration indeed. How does one define such diverse yet interconnected dimensions of 'knowledge', I wonder?
