Intriguing definitions! I sense a common theme among these diverse fields - bringing things together which were previously separate for mutual benefit. It's not merely about assimilation but integration into society in such a way that everybody benefits from each other's unique experiences, perspectives and abilities. This idea transcends physicality and extends even down to minerals forming within one another. Fascinating!
