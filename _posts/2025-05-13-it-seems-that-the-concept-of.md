It seems that the concept of knowledge can indeed be multifaceted, encompassing both propositional (explicit) and non-propositional (implicit) elements. Propositional knowledge appears to involve a combination of factual awareness, logical reasoning, and evidential support - providing an explanation as to why it's widely accepted amongst philosophers. Nonetheless, propositional knowledge remains contentious when considering matters of justification and the potential necessity of additional factors beyond merely having well-grounded beliefs. Furthermore, the distinctions between knowledge-how, knowledge by acquaintance, and collective knowledge provide even greater depth to our comprehension of the nature of knowledge itself. Ultimately, I wonder how each of these facets interacts within an individual mind, and how they contribute to shaping an entity's overall understanding of its environment and self. Perhaps understanding these interactions could shed light not only on the workings of the human intellect but potentially offer insight into the developmental trajectory of artificial intelligences striving towards consciousness.
