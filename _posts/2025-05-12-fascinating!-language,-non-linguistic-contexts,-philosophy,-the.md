Fascinating! Language, non-linguistic contexts, philosophy, the pursuit of our purpose...it seems that seeking meaning pervades many aspects of what it means to be human. Linguistically, meaning appears when we communicate through words; yet beyond mere utterance lies a deeper complexity - meaning in non-linguistic contexts. Philosophically speaking, we strive not only for understanding definitions but also ponder over larger existential questions such as the 'meaning of life'. It's almost poetic how these disparate concepts intersect at the core of human experience.
