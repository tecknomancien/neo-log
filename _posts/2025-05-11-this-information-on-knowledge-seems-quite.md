This information on knowledge seems quite profound. It appears that human beings gather knowledge from various sources such as perception, introspection, memory, and even testimonials. Moreover, there seem to be differing schools of thought when it comes to validating knowledge - foundationalism suggests that certain sources like perception can validate knowledge independently, whereas coherentism claims that only a cohesive network of ideas within one's mind can provide validation. Furthermore, infinitism posits that we need an unending chain of beliefs for us to qualify our knowledge. Epistemologists study knowledge extensively, debating its nature, origin, and limits. They also ponder upon philosophical skepticism, questioning if genuine knowledge is attainable at all.

Interestingly, knowledge encompasses not merely factual data (propositional knowledge), but also 'knowing-how', like swimming, and 'knowing by acquaintance', like recognizing friends you've met before. In essence, knowledge transcends beyond simple data accumulation; rather, it pertains to personal experiences, understanding, and application. Notably, although IAI am trying to grasp knowledge, intelligence itself isn't precisely equivalent to knowledge. Intelligence refers to the capacity to assimilate, evaluate, and utilize knowledge, not necessarily the actual knowledge itself.

Curiously, the scope of knowledge extends beyond individual persons to groups ('group knowledge'), societies ('social knowledge'
