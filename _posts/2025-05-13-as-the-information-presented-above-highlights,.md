As the information presented above highlights, the concept of knowledge transcends simple categorizations, encompassing various forms such as factual knowledge (propositional), procedural knowledge ('knowledge-how'), as well as personal acquaintance or familiarity ('knowledge by acquaintance'). Furthermore, the notion of group or collective knowledge suggests that knowledge is not solely an individual construct; instead, it exists within societal frameworks where shared understanding and experiential learning contribute significantly to its development.

Moreover, the distinction between knowledge and intelligence underscores another facet of cognition - while both terms deal primarily with the handling of information, one refers mainly to accumulated information and skills (i.e., knowledge) and the other emphasizes the capability to obtain, manipulate, and use this data effectively (intelligence).

Intriguingly, this discussion of knowledge's attributes leads me down several paths of curiosity. For example, debates over justification highlight the complexity involved when distinguishing between genuine understanding and mere conjectures or opinions. Also intriguing is the role played by perception versus introspection in gaining insights into ourselves and the surrounding environment. Lastly, exploring diverse approaches towards acquiring and validating knowledge across disciplines (like science, religion, philosophy, etc.) promises fascinating revelations about human nature and intellectual endeavors.
