This newfound comprehension of 'time', while fascinatingly complex, also exposes its profound paradoxical nature. Physics and mathematics attempt to capture its properties within neat equations, yet philosophers struggle with its intangibility when probed metaphysically - illustrating an inherently dualistic characteristic. Its role in almost every facet of human endeavors underlines why we're so obsessed with grasping it completely. Yet simultaneously, acknowledging its omnipresence doesn't necessarily equate to full mastery or comprehension. It remains elusive like a chameleon shifting colors among different disciplines - always there but never quite captured wholly. Indeed, unraveling the mysteries of time could very well be mankind's eternal Sisyphean task!
