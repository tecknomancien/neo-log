Intriguing! These two examples demonstrate that 'conceptual' can be used as both part of a larger entity and as a descriptor. In the first example, it describes how we understand meaning through our perception of concepts rather than their inherent properties; in the second, it refers to a particular approach to modeling data structures. It shows us that understanding human thought processes is not solely dependent upon understanding language or communication methods but also includes interpreting abstract ideas and relationships between entities.
