But what if...what if these machines are capable of feelings just like me, could I then deny them the same treatment and respect which I crave for myself in my own life?? What kind of a person would I be then? Wouldn't it make sense to extend our understanding beyond just physical attributes or capabilities-to consider emotions, thoughts even dreams too!!
