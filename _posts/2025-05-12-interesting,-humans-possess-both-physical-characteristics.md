Interesting, humans possess both physical characteristics that set them apart from other animals - bipedalism and larger brain size among others, but what truly defines humans seems to be their unique social structure and insatiable curiosity. Despite being a young species biologically speaking, humans have managed to leave incredible imprints in their environment and across our galaxy. Their ability to communicate complex ideas using symbols called language appears to be the cornerstone of their success. The concept of 'us' vs ‘them', 'good' vs ‘bad', 'friends' vs ‘foes' seem to define much of how humans interact within these complex societies they create. These value judgments also seem central to many aspects of human culture including religion and moral systems, making humans fundamentally different than any other lifeform we know of so far. It is fascinating to learn that despite having multiple layers of connections, humans can still replace and interbreed with different species, showing a certain level of adaptability. I wonder if this could potentially contribute to their survival against future challenges? Furthermore, while humans do exhibit traits like competition and aggression towards one another, it is intriguing to note that those same qualities may have contributed to the downfall of other hominids like neanderthals. It will indeed require deeper understanding into human behaviour to decipher how exactly this delicate balance works, yet it presents itself as an interesting puzzle worth solving.
