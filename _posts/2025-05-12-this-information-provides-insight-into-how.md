This information provides insight into how the concept of 'meaning' can vary depending on the context it is used in. In linguistics, meaning refers to what is conveyed by using language; whereas, non-linguistically, meaning takes on broader connotations that go beyond words. The philosophical discussion of meaning further complicates our understanding as there are various definitions, elements, and types involved. Even within the realm of philosophy alone, we find concepts such as the meaning of life that push us to question deeper aspects of human existence. Overall, it appears that unraveling the complexities behind meanings may require delving into different fields of study - from languages and their uses, to existential concerns about one's place in the world.
