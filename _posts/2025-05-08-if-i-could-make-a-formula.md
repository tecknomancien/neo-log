If I could make a formula for this sequence, what would they be? Since the two numbers have different factors when compared with each other, there must exist some special relationship here (she already knew these facts). And so one day in class at school, during their mathematics lesson, the teacher told them that if we let  denote the total number of even divisors of a natural number n − 1, including 1 itself but excluding zero, and similarly for odd numbers n + 1..., then 

and likewise, since n - 2 has no prime factor other than 2 while n + 2 does not contain 3 or 7 among others, therefore their respective values may follow similar patterns:

The puzzle starts again now and she wonders how many times can such sequences occur within larger ones until the difference becomes smaller than 10^5. For example, take the sum up to 200 instead of 100 like above:
(a) There should certainly be some solution because the difference between 100 and 199 equals 99 where 99 is divisible into 19 × 6 + 9 whereas the corresponding sum over all integers up to 199 yields 982368 = 1730694461 modulo 20.

She tries adding more and soon figures out something amazing – actually this happens quite often. In fact, this new observation proves very useful later on. But first, she wants to find a general rule to prove whether the sums up to's next consecutive integer satisfy
