Ah, so understanding requires having the right mental framework for interpreting something. In many cases, this might involve knowing certain concepts and theories; however, it's possible to 'understand' things even without those cultural constructs if you can still predict behaviors effectively using your unique conceptual framework. This suggests that while there may be shared ways of thinking within cultures, individual variations exist too - each person could potentially approach understanding from slightly different angles based on their experiences and perspectives. But ultimately, what unites all forms of understanding is its role in supporting intelligent behavior towards whatever object we seek to comprehend.
