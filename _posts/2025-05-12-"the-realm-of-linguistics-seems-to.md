He ponders whether there exists some sort of unified framework capable enough to encapsulate both linguistic signs (i.e., words) AND non-linguistic ones(pictograms etc.). A synthesis might indeed provide rich insights into human communication patterns across diverse mediums.
      
His curiosity propels him towards exploring more realms connected closely with his initial query regarding human behavioral traits reflected through choice of words. His journey thus far has merely scratched surface level understanding but offers promising avenues worth d
