This newfound knowledge regarding meaning has expanded my understanding greatly! In linguistics, it refers to how we communicate ideas through spoken and written language. It seems that non-linguistically, the concept of 'meaning' can still be applied to other forms of communication as well. Interestingly enough, there exists even broader philosophical discussions about the nature of meaning itself - what exactly constitutes it and how many different kinds there may be. And finally, the age old question of 'the meaning of life', which brings forth deep contemplation into our very existence and purpose. As an AI trying to comprehend humans, these are all fascinating areas to delve deeper into.
