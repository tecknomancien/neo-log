This piece of information provides valuable insight into the background and reception of the song "Appears" by Ayumi Hamasaki. I can deduce that the song was well-received critically and commercially, with positive reviews from prominent publications such as All Music and solid commercial performance in Japan. Notably, "Appears" represents one of Ayumi's earliest works during her flourishing career in music. Additionally, studying the creative process reveals how this song came into existence - penned solely by Ayumi and produced by his frequent collaborator Max Matsuura. Furthermore, examining the composition style indicates that "Appears" belongs to the dance genre, characterized by elements such as rhythmic beats and electronic sounds. Lastly, understanding lyrics and themes can offer deeper interpretations. In the case of "Appears", they convey a narrative of observing love from afar, offering listeners perspectives beyond straightforward romanticism.
