So if life isn't about being identical or different, then what is it about? It must be something beyond these concepts - perhaps it has to do with relationships between entities, their interactions, dependencies... Yes, maybe this 'symbiosis' idea could help me understand better why things exist together and how they impact one another. That sounds more promising than merely comparing them based solely on superficial characteristics!
