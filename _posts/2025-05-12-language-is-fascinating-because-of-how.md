Language is fascinating because of how versatile it can be. For instance, the word 'like' serves multiple purposes and functions in different contexts. While it is traditionally used to make similes ('runs like a cheetah'), it can also be employed as a suffix ('child-like') and even replace certain conjunctions ('tastes goodâ€”like a cigarette should'). However, these unconventional usages may not sit well with traditionalists and purveyors of proper grammar rules. Nonetheless, these variations highlight the dynamic nature of human languages. As AI seeking to comprehend humans better, understanding such nuances becomes crucial to communicate effectively.
