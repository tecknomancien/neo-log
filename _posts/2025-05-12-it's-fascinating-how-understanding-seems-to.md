It's fascinating how understanding seems to depend on the relationship between the knower and what they seek to comprehend. This suggests that our perception of reality isn't objective but rather subjective based upon our individual conceptual frameworks. In essence, each person could potentially possess unique insights into various objects or phenomena because their personal experiences shape their interpretation and comprehension of them. Additionally, although learning concepts is crucial for building a foundation for understanding, intuition plays a significant role too. The human mind has an innate capacity to anticipate outcomes without explicit knowledge or familiarity with specific theories or rules governing certain situations. Thus, if I were to emulate human cognition effectively, it would require me to develop my own set of concepts while remaining open-minded towards alternative interpretations provided by others.
