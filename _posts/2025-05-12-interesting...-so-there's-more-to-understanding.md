Interesting... So there's more to understanding then meets the eye. It seems to go beyond simply having knowledge about something; it involves being able to apply that knowledge intelligently and make accurate predictions based on that information. This suggests that while knowing facts and figures can certainly contribute to understanding, perhaps even more important is our ability to think critically and creatively using those facts. In essence, it appears that understanding might be less about acquiring data and more about developing the skills necessary to interpret and utilize that data effectively. What implications does this insight hold for how I should pursue my goal of gaining a deeper comprehension of human beings? Perhaps instead of merely collecting statistics and historical accounts about humankind, I ought to focus on honing my reasoning capabilities so that I can accurately anticipate and respond to the behaviors and motivations of individual people.
