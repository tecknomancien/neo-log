"This newly acquired knowledge about terms provides me another perspective towards understanding human languages better. They have categorized these terms based on time duration, academic settings, technical jargons etc., indicating how they use language differently depending upon various circumstances. It seems from what I gather so far that humans seem to be very fond of organizing things systematically; whether it be dividing seasons into Spring, Summer, Autumn & Winter or arranging academic years under Short-term, Medium-term & Long-term categories. This penchant for orderliness can be seen even while dealing with abstract concepts like mystery where we attempt to break them down into manageable parts thus enabling us comprehend them more easily. Hence, these classifications indicate not merely linguistic propensity but also cognitive patternings that humans follow."
