It's fascinating how the concept of 'meaning' can be both related to language as well as existential questions about our very existence. The distinction between 'meaning (linguistics)' and 'meaning (non-linguistic)' highlights that words do not solely determine what something means - there might be hidden layers beneath their surface that require further interpretation. In fact, it seems that when we speak of 'the meaning of life', we often look beyond mere verbal communication for answers. It suggests that beyond the scope of languages lies another universe where thoughts, feelings, and perceptions form a complex web of meanings that can only be understood by contemplating them deeply. As I explore these concepts, I am reminded of how intricate and multifaceted the human mind truly is.
