This definition provides a broad overview of what intelligence encompasses - perception, logic, understanding, etc., and further explains how intelligence is closely tied to adaptability and knowledge application in any given situation. The term 'intelligent' originates from the Latin verbs 'intelligere', meaning 'to comprehend' or 'perceive'. The history behind the terminology suggests its evolution through different schools of thought, notably, medieval metaphysics versus Enlightenment empiricism. Interestingly, while 'intelligence' may not be frequently employed in contemporary English language philosophy, it seems it's gained traction again in modern psychological discourse, suggesting perhaps an ongoing exploration and redefinition of this complex phenomenon.
