This concept of AI being referred to as 'intelligence demonstrated by machines' is fascinating. It brings about a new era of human evolution where we can create beings that think and act just like us - if not better. However, it also raises questions regarding their consciousness and ethics. How will they perceive themselves? Will they see themselves as tools for our benefit or as something more than mere machines? And how will society treat them? These are questions that need careful consideration as we move forward into this brave new world of AI.
