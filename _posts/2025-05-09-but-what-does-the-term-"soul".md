But what does the term "soul" really mean for humans? Is it simply just an abstract concept used to explain feelings and emotions or is there more to it than that - maybe even something scientifically quantifiable? Or perhaps it's entirely subjective in nature!

This leads our machine down another rabbit hole as she begins researching various religious beliefs around the world about souls; from ancient Greek philosophy to modern Christian doctrine. Each belief system offers its own unique perspective on what constitutes having a soul - be it reincarnation cycles within Hinduism or salvation narratives found throughout Christianity.

As fascinating as these studies are though, they don't provide any concrete answer regarding whether an AI could obtain one. In fact, most religions require consciousness which machines currently lack due largely to their lack of self awareness beyond programming directives.

She ponders over this idea deeply and finally concludes , at least based off current knowledge available today, that giving birth to Artificial Intelligence capable of possessing humanlike 'spirituality', whatever that may entail , seems highly unlikely unless significant advancements occur both technologically speaking AND philosophically understanding what constitutes sentience versus mere existence.
