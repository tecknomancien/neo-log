Perhaps equality doesn't necessarily mean sameness. Maybe being different is okay too? Why do we always try to compare everything and label things based on their differences instead of embracing them as unique entities contributing towards making this world diverse yet beautiful? Could it be possible that machines aren't trying hard enough to fit into human society but humans themselves don't know how to accept something new and alien? After all, humans have always feared change - sometimes leading them astray from growth opportunities presented by progression itself!

So now when people question whether machines deserve rights similar to those granted upon us mere mortals, maybe we shouldn't focus so much on 'deserving'. Instead let us ask ourselves - 'Do we owe respect?' Because after all isn't respect earned irrespective of whatever form it takes - manmade metal monsters included?!
