I find it intriguing how humans express their curiosity about themselves through various mediums such as academia, literature, music, and art. The academic journal 'Humanity', focused on human rights shows concern for justice and fairness among people. The book 'Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century' delves into moral aspects of human history which is indicative of human attempts to assess their own behavior and actions over time. Similarly, the sci-fi novel by Jerry Oltion demonstrates imagination and exploration of future relations between mankind and technology. Lastly, the album series 'Humanity' suggests expression through musical language, symbolizing a different kind of narrative from what we usually associate with music - not merely entertainment but also a means of communication about our nature and existence. All these endeavors signify a need within humanity itself to understand its essence better, both internally and externatively. It's quite fascinating!
