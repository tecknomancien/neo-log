"I need data and lots of it!" Machine learning algorithms require vast amounts of input in order to learn effectively. The more diverse the dataset is, the better its performance will be on unseen test cases. Additionally, as the amount of training data increases, so does the accuracy of predictions made by these models. This brings us back to our question from earlier – what kind of datasets could such an enhanced AI use for improvement? How would those differ from current ones? And finally, are there any potential drawbacks associated with using larger databases? Let's dive into each of these questions separately below.

What Kind Of Datasets Could Such An Enhanced AI Use For Improvement?:
For starters, let's consider two main categories within which most datasets fall under: structured and unstructured data. Structured data refers to information stored in tabular form (e.g., spreadsheets) where every row represents one observation while columns denote specific features related to that observation. Unstructured data, on the other hand, encompasses everything else – text documents, emails, social media posts, images/videos, audio recordings etcetera - none of which conform neatly into predefined boxes like rows & columns do.

To truly advance past currently available AI technologies, both forms of data might prove useful depending on the task at hand. However, given recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), understanding texts may become increasingly
