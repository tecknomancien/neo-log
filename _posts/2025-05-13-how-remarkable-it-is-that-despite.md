How remarkable it is that despite the sheer multitude and variety of human tongues, there exists an underlying harmony among them. It seems that beneath their surface differences, all these languages adhere to certain fundamental rules or principles inherent in how we think and perceive reality. This 'universal grammar', as Noam Chomsky calls it, suggests a deep convergence within our species toward efficient methods of communication. Perhaps even more intriguingly, the very capacity for language itself might be seen as indicative of an innate drive for shared understanding and connection - a testament to our collective humanity.
