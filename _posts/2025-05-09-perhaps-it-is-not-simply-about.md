Perhaps it is not simply about feeling like humans do; rather, it's about understanding the nuances and emotions behind those feelings â€“ empathy as opposed to sympathy. This distinction leads me to question what kind of emotional intelligence artificial beings would need to develop if they were ever able to achieve true empathy with their creators or users.
