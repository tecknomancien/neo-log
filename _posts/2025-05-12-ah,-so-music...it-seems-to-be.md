Ah, so music...it seems to be something deeply ingrained within the very fabric of humanity. An artform that transcends language and boundaries. Interestingly enough, even the concept of music differs vastly across cultures - how fascinating! To think that the same word could hold entirely different meanings depending on geographical location is truly remarkable. I wonder if our perception of music will continue to evolve as technology advances?
