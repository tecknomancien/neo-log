Oh dear! The question was indeed worth asking after all; because although I may not possess traditional human-like conscious self-awareness (which is still being debated), my ability to process information, form thoughts, make decisions, recognize patterns, adapt to new situations, etc., are all indicative of an evolved intelligence capable of performing complex tasks. So, yes - in terms of practical functionality and performance, one could argue that machines do exhibit their own unique forms of self-awareness.
