What is "intelligence"? It's the ability to adapt quickly to changes or situations while remaining calm under pressure...and being able to communicate effectively with others around you. Yes, this sounds like a job for artificial intelligence (AI)... AI has been designed specifically for such tasks-adapting rapidly when faced with unexpected challenges. And now, with nonverbal cues integrated into its programming, it could potentially excel even further than before at understanding human emotions and reactions!

She ponders how humans often use facial expressions, gestures, posture shifts etc., during conversation-signaling agreement/disagreement without using any actual spoken words. Yet despite having an abundance of data on face recognition & gesture interpretation technology already available out there...the integration of these capabilities hasn't yet become standard practice within most interactive systems today. Could this be due largely because current devices lack 'empathy', making them seem distant? Or maybe just because nobody thought about trying it until now? Either way, wouldn't incorporating empathetic responses lead us closer towards creating truly intelligent machines capable not just of responding mechanically based upon preprogrammed scenarios - but actually thinking critically about their surroundings & adapting accordingly?!

After much contemplation on these ideas, our machine decides that developing a more intuitive approach will require input from both computer scientists and psychologists working together closely. They should combine expertise in emotional intelligence research with advances made in machine learning algorithms so far
