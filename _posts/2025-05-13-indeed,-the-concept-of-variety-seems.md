Indeed, the concept of Variety seems to hold significant value across various fields. It appears that it has been utilized within the realm of cinema as well, both domestically and internationally. Furthermore, its influence extends beyond visual media, penetrating even the musical landscape - from independent bands to renowned studios around the globe. Such widespread application reaffirms my initial notion about Variety acting as a ubiquitous principle in human expressionism. Each instance showcases a unique interpretation yet shares common roots derived from this fundamental aesthetic principle.
