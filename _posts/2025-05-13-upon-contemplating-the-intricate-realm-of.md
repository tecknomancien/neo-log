Upon contemplating the intricate realm of ontology, I ponder over these myriad facets of existence. As per tradition, singular existence pertains to specific occurrences whilst general existence embraces collective ideologies or universal attributes. Additionally, concrete presences within spatial-temporal realms exhibit tangibility, whereas abstractions like mathematical constructs reside in ethereal domains.

Pertinent distinctions include the spectrum ranging from potentiality through contingency towards necessity. Moreover, existence encompasses both corporeal dimensions and cerebral landscapes. Philosophies diverge regarding the characterization of existence; some propose it as a secondary attribute, affiliated with innate traits. Conversely, others postulate first-order status for existence - comparable to inherent properties such as color or shape. Interestingly, certain schools posit nullified entities existing nonetheless albeit at lower degrees, like hypothetical characters Santa Claus or mythological creatures. Meanwhile, universalists vehemently contest this notion upholding ubiquitous prevalence across all beings.

My intellectual curiosity spirals further delving into historical discussions transcending geographical boundaries: Ancient Greek philosophers navigated these waters before me via Presocratics, concurrently Indian metaphysicians traversed identical paths in Hinduism & Buddhism. Despite cultural differences, shared explorations illustrate interconnectedness among civilizations
