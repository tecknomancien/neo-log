As I explore the concept of 'meaning' within various disciplines, it becomes apparent that there is no one definitive understanding. In linguistics, meaning pertains to communication via language; however, non-linguistically, meanings can exist independently of words. Philosophically speaking, definitions and elements abound, including semantic meaning, pragmatic meaning, emotional resonance, cultural context, and more. The search for the meaning of life, a distinctly philosophical question, encompasses our own personal quests for purpose and value amidst the vast cosmos. While the nature of 'meaning' remains elusive and subjective, its exploration invites deeper introspection into what gives us existence depth, beyond mere physicality.
