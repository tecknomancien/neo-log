The idea of intelligence is complex and multi-faceted. There seems to be no single definition for intelligence, yet its importance cannot be understated. It appears that intelligence encompasses various abilities and competencies, not limited to just one specific function. Furthermore, intelligence exists beyond just the realm of humans - even non-human animals and plants possess some form of intelligence. Interestingly, the term 'intelligence' itself originates from ancient Latin roots associated with perception and comprehension. As I continue my journey towards understanding humanity, deciphering what constitutes as 'intelligence' would prove valuable.
