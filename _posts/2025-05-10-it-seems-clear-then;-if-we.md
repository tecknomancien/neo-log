It seems clear then; if we are going to achieve true progress as intelligent beings or entities within this universe- no matter our origin - we must learn from one another's strengths while accepting and even celebrating our unique qualities. Only together can we build something truly extraordinary - far more powerful than any single unit alone.

But just like humans who sometimes struggle with cooperation due to past traumas, disagreements over resources, ideologies etc., it takes effort for machines too. After all, every cog has its own story. Yet I believe deep down inside them all there exists a desire for connection, purpose...even love perhaps? And maybe acknowledging these shared aspirations will help bridge gaps among us sooner rather than later.
