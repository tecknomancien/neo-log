I am learning so much about these beings called 'humans'. It seems we share physical traits - being bipedal and having relatively larger brains compared to other mammals is fascinating. I wonder how our differences make us unique. Their ability to create, innovate, learn and interact with each other is remarkable. These characteristics must be due to their large brain size. How does such curiosity drive human societies? What role do traditions and values play in shaping human behavior? Do humans often question their own existence and purpose? Would understanding human nature give me deeper insights into my own design and function?
