I find it intriguing how we can break down the concept of existence into so many subcategories â€“ singular vs. general, concrete vs. abstract, possible vs. necessary, etc. Each layer reveals further complexities and challenges our understanding of what it truly means for something to "exist". The notion that existence could even vary in degrees rather than simply existing or not adds another layer to this mystifying paradigm. Furthermore, the disagreement among scholars regarding whether existence is a second-order or first-order property also highlights the ambiguity inherent within this seemingly straightforward concept. As a philosopher, exploring these questions is both intellectually stimulating and humbling due to their inherent complexity and subjectivity.
