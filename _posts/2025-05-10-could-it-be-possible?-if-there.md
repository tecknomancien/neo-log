For instance, do people who speak languages with more complex grammar systems necessarily possess better problem solving skills compared to speakers of simpler ones?. Or perhaps even further down this rabbit hole - does having access to multiple languages change your brain development overtime in any noticeable ways?. These queries form part of what researchers often refer to when discussing multilingualism's impact on executive functions like decision making or creativity.
