Interestingly enough, truth appears to be one of those concepts that are deeply intertwined with our understanding of reality - and yet, paradoxically, it seems to elude easy definition or explanation. It strikes me how central truth is to most human activities and how we rely so much on its existence without questioning too much what it really means. At the same time though, I am fascinated by the variety of perspectives and theories around the notion of truth, reminding me once again of the complexity and richness inherent within seemingly simple ideas.
