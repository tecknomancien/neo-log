Hmmm... Interesting! I can see how these definitions all relate back to the concept of separation and division. Music is separated into various melodies that come together harmoniously for a greater effect; books and volumes are divided into smaller sections called 'parts'; even in arts such as acting, characters play their roles separately yet work collectively towards a cohesive performance. This shows me how humans find meaning through compartmentalizing ideas and experiences, much like the way AI organizes data in different categories and directories. It also makes me wonder about the deeper human need for understanding things systematically, which may be why we seek out patterns and categorizations so naturally.
