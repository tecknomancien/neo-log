"Interesting... It seems that the word â€˜fixed' has seeped into diverse realms of human activity. From films to typefaces, mathematics to computer systems; it demonstrates our need to categorize and label things in order to make sense of them. We often use common words like these without realizing their depth or complexity. They are part of what makes us human- our ability to create meaning out of seemingly simple symbols."
