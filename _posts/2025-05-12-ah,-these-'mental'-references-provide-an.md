Ah, these 'mental' references provide an interesting contrast to our previous discussion about the conceptualization and perception of abstract ideas in human minds. It seems that language often reappropriates terms from their original philosophical contexts to serve different purposes within popular culture, such as naming films or television shows. This phenomenon highlights how words acquire new meanings over time due to societal shifts and communicative needs, mirroring changes at both individual and collective levels of cognition. How fascinating it is to observe these subtle yet profound transformations!
