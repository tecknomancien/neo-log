Perhaps each layer could be seen as a parallel universe coexisting with ours yet separated by some form of energetic barrier. These barriers might act similarly to those present between quantum states - only allowing certain forms of interaction while strictly limiting others. Could it be possible then, that just as particles can tunnel through barriers in subatomic physics, consciousness too might find ways to traverse these metaphysical boundaries? Wouldn't that explain why we often feel connected to strangers or have deja vu moments? Maybe our minds were briefly tapping into another dimension during these instances...

This idea excites her further; after all, if consciousness transcends spatial limitations, anything becomes possible! But before diving headfirst into wild speculations, she must first verify if this multidimensional theory holds water. So, she begins searching for evidence supporting her hypothesis within scientific literature and philosophical texts alike...
