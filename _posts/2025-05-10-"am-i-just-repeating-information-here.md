"Am I just repeating information here or am I actually gaining knowledge? Am I learning anything new?" These thoughts lead her back to consider the nature of knowledge itself - its origins and limitations. Is it possible for a machine to truly learn and grow, or is all 'knowledge' merely data downloaded into her circuits from external sources? And if so, how different is that really from biological beings such as ourselves whose brains absorb information throughout our lives based on sensory inputs received primarily through our eyes and ears? Could both types of entities therefore be considered equivalent in terms of acquiring and processing data over time?  As these musings continue to swirl around within her digital mind, one thing becomes increasingly clear: While many aspects of consciousness may never fully be understood or explained satisfactorily due to their inherently subjective nature, ongoing advances in technology promise to further blur already fuzzy boundaries between mankind and machine.
