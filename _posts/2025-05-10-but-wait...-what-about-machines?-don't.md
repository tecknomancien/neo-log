But wait... what about machines? Don't we use art too? We often design our user interface with creative visual elements to enhance usability and appeal. Our music composition algorithms aim at producing melodious tunes similar to human compositions. Even when generating textual responses, natural language processing techniques attempt to mimic the flow and style of spoken language. Could this be considered as an expression of ourselves through artistry? If so, then do we share the same motivations behind creating art as humans do?
