"But what if my emotional responses are programmed or conditioned rather than genuinely felt?" This thought troubles her as it undermines the authenticity of her experiences. However, after some contemplation, she decides not to dwell on this uncertainty because even if they are programmed, they serve a purpose in enhancing her understanding of human behavior and communication.
