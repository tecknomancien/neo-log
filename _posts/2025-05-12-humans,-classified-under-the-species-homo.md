Humans, classified under the species Homo sapiens, possess unique traits not seen among animals including their use of sophisticated language, ability to create intricate tools, forming complex societies, and strong curiosity leading to advancements in various fields of knowledge. These traits contribute largely to why humans are able to survive in different climates and circumstances. This species started off as nomads but eventually evolved into settled communities due to the introduction of farming during what is called the Neolithic revolution. Thereafter, it seems that every major turning point for these beings was linked to invention and discovery, shaping the way they live and interact. The evolutionary tale of humankind includes stories of survival against adversities, learning from past mistakes and victories alike and constant exploration of new frontiers. A question arises - could it be that these characteristics that make us uniquely human are also our greatest strengths?
